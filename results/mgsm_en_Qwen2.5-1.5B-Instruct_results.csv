Step 1) First, we need to find out how many eggs Janet's ducks lay per day. We know this number is 16 eggs per day.
Step 2) Next, let's calculate how many eggs Janes eats for breakfast. Since she eats three eggs every morning, she will eat a total of 3 x 1 day = 3 eggs.
Step 3) Now, we'll calculate how many eggs Janes uses to bake muffins for her friends. As mentioned, she uses four eggs for baking. 
Step 4) To find out how many eggs are left over, we subtract the eggs used for breakfast and those used for baking from the total number of eggs laid per day:

Step 1) Calculate the total amount of feed given out by multiplying the number of chickens by the daily feeding requirement per chicken.
Step 2) Add up all the amounts of feed given out during the morning and afternoon to find the total amount of feed given out over those two periods.
Step 3) Subtract the sum of the morning and afternoon feed from Step 2 from the total daily feeding requirement (which we found in Step 1) to get the amount of feed needed for the final meal of the day.
Step 1) Daily feeding requirement per chicken: 3 cups
Step 2) Number of chickens: 20
Step 3) Total daily feed required: 3 cups/chicken x 20 chickens = 60 cups/day
Step 4) Feed given out in the morning: 15 cups
Step 5) Feed given out in the afternoon: 25 cups
Step 6) Total feed given out in the first two meals: 15 cups + 25 cups = 40 cups
Step 7) To calculate the amount of feed needed for the final meal: subtract the total feed given out in the first two meals from the total daily feed required
Step 8) Final meal feed: 60 cups/day - 40 cups = 20 cups

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Determine the number of sheep in Charleston based on Seattle's count. Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, and Seattle has 20 sheep, we calculate this by multiplying Seattle's count by 4:
STeP 1) Charleston's sheep count = Seattle's sheep count × 4
STeP 1) Charleston's sheep count = 20 × 4
STeP 1) Charleston's sheep count = 80 sheep
Step 2) Next, determine the number of sheep in Toulouse. Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, we multiply Charleston's count by 2:
STeP 2) Toulouse's sheep count = Charleston's sheep count × 2
STeP 2) Toulouse's sheep count = 80 × 2
STeP 2) Toulouse's sheep count = 160 sheep
Step 3) Finally, add up all the sheep counted (Seattle, Charleston, and Toulouse):
STeP 3) Total sheep = Seattle's sheep count + Charleston's sheep count + Toulouse's sheep count
STeP 3) Total sheep = 20 + 80 + 160
STeP 3) Total sheep = 260 sheep

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to find out how many downloads there were in the second month. Since it was three times as many as the first month's 60 downloads, we multiply 60 by 3, which equals 180 downloads.
Step 2) Next, we need to calculate what happened to these downloads in the third month. We know that the downloads were reduced by 30%, or.3 when expressed as a decimal. To find this amount, we multiply 180 by.3, which gives us 54 fewer downloads than the previous month.
Step 3) Finally, we add up all the downloads over the three months. We start with 60 downloads (first month), add 180 downloads (second month), and subtract 54 downloads (third month). This gives us 60 + 180 - 54 = 286 downloads in total.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie starts with as x.
Step 2) She sold one-third of them at the green house, which means she sold (x/3) vacuum cleaners.
Step 3) The remaining vacuum cleaners after selling to the green house would be x - (x/3), or 2x/3.
Step 4) She then sold 2 more to the red house, leaving her with 2x/3 - 2 vacuum cleaners.
Step 5) Finally, she sold half of what remained at the orange house, meaning she sold ((2x/3 - 2)/2) vacuum cleaners.
Step 6) This leaves us with 5 vacuum cleaners, so we set up the equation:
Step 7) 5 = (2x/3 - 2)/2
Step 8) Solving this equation gives us x = 15.
Step 9) Therefore, Melanie started with 15 vacuum cleaners.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) We know that Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount was applied to the original price.
Step 2) Let's denote the original price as \( P \).
Step 3) Since the discount is 25%, this means that Kyle paid 75% (or 0.75 times) of the original price because 100% - 25% = 75%.
Step 4) Therefore, we can set up the equation: \( 0.75P = $19.50 \)

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) John runs 3 days a week and 60 miles a week. This means he runs an average of 60 / 3 = 20 miles per day.
Step 2) On the first day, he runs 3 hours. Let's assume this is his maximum running speed (V).
Step 3) The remaining two days, he runs half as much as on the first day. Therefore, he runs 20 / 2 = 10 miles on each of those days.
Step 4) To find out his average speed (V), we need to calculate the total distance covered in one week and divide it by the number of days.
Step 5) Total distance covered in one week = Distance on the first day + Distance on the second day + Distance on the third day
Step 6) Total distance covered in one week = V * 3 + 10 + 10
Step 7) We know that the total distance covered in one week is 60 miles.
Step 8) So, we can set up the equation: V * 3 + 10 + 10 = 60
Step 9) Simplify the equation: V * 3 + 20 = 60
Step 10) Subtract 20 from both sides: V * 3 = 40
Step 11) Divide both sides by 3: V = 40 / 3 ≈ 13.33 mph

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to determine Dana's running speed. Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can use this information to find out Dana's running speed. Let's denote her running speed by \( R \), her walking speed by \( W \), and her skipping speed by \( S \). We know that \( S = \frac{R}{2} \).
Step 2) Given that she skips at 3 mph, we can calculate her running speed as follows: \( S = \frac{R}{2} \Rightarrow 3 = \frac{R}{2} \Rightarrow R = 6 \) mph.
Step 3) Next, we need to figure out how long she runs and walks in the given time frame. Since she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking, we can set up an equation using these proportions: 
Step 4) Let's assume she spends \( T \) hours in total. Then \( \frac{T}{3} \) hours are spent running and \( \frac{2T}{3} \) hours are spent walking.
Step 5) Using her running and walking speeds, we can write the following equations:
Step 6) Running distance: \( \text{Distance}_\text{run} = R \times \frac{T}{3} \)
Step 7) Walking distance: \( \text{Distance}_\text{walk} = W \times \frac{2T}{3} \)
Step 8) Total distance traveled: \( \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance}_\text{run} + \text{Distance}_\text{walk} \)
Step 9) Substituting the values we found earlier into these equations, we get:
Step 10) \( \text{Total Distance} = 6 \times \frac{T}{3} + W \times \frac{2T}{3} \)
Step 11) Simplifying further, we get:
Step 12) \( \text{Total Distance} = 2T + \frac{2WT}{3} \)
Step 13) To solve for \( T \), we can substitute the value of \( W \) (which we don't actually need to find since we're not asked about it):
Step 14) \( \text{Total Distance} = 2T + \frac{2"

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's determine how far Polly can throw the javelin without holding the gemstone. According to the problem, this is given as 400 feet.
Step 2) When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding the gemstone. Therefore, we need to multiply the original throwing distance by 3.
Step 3) To find out how far Polly can throw the javelin when holding the gemstone, we calculate 400 feet multiplied by 3.
Step 4) The calculation is: 400 feet × 3 = 1200 feet.
Step 5) Since the dragon's flames are located within a range of 1000 feet, we need to compare the distance Polly can throw the javelin (1200 feet) with the dragon's flame range (1000 feet).
Step 6) The difference between the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin (1200 feet) and the dragon's flame range (1000 feet) will tell us how far outside the dragon's flames Polly can stand.
Step 7) We subtract the dragon's flame range from the maximum distance Polly can throw the javelin: 1200 feet - 1000 feet = 200 feet.
Step 8) This result indicates that if Polly stands 200 feet away from the dragon, she will be able to hit it with the javelin even though the dragon's flames extend up to 1000 feet.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. According to the problem, she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. Since she wrote 5 articles on Monday, she wrote (2/5)*5 = 2*1 = 2 more articles on Tuesday.
Step 2) Therefore, the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday was 5 + 2 = 7 articles.
Step 3) Next, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday. The problem states that she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. So, she wrote 2*7 = 14 articles on Wednesday.
Step 4) Now we know the number of articles written by Meredith over the three days: Monday - 5 articles, Tuesday - 7 articles, Wednesday - 14 articles.
Step 5) To find the total time spent writing these articles, multiply the number of articles by the average time it takes to write one article (which is given as 4 hours).
Step 6) Total time spent writing = Number of articles * Average time per article

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's calculate the number of blue ties John bought. Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, and we know that blue ties cost $40 each, then John must have bought 2/3 times as many blue ties as red ties (because 2+2=4, and if you divide that by 3, you get 2/3).
Step 2) We know that John spent a total of $200 on blue ties. To find out how many blue ties he bought, we need to divide the total amount he spent ($200) by the price per blue tie ($40). 
Step 3) 200 / 40 = 5
Step 4) This tells us that John bought 5 blue ties. However, since we also know that he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, this means he bought 10 red ties (because 2 x 5 = 10).
Step 5) Finally, to find out how much he spent on ties in total, we simply add up the costs of all the blue ties and the red ties. 
Step 6) Cost of blue ties: 5 x $40 = $200
Step 7) Cost of red ties: 10 x (40 + 50%) x $40 = 10 x $48 = $480
Step 8) Total cost: $200 + $480 = $680

Step 1) First, we need to find out how many floors are occupied. Since 3/4 of the building is occupied, we multiply the total number of floors by 3/4: 
Step 2) Occupied Floors = Total Floors x (3/4)
Step 3) Occupied Floors = 15 x (3/4) = 11.25
Step 4) This means that 11.25 floors are occupied, leaving 15 - 11.25 = 3.75 floors unoccupied.
Step 5) Each floor contains 8 units, so we need to calculate the number of unoccupied units on these 3.75 floors:

Step 1) Tom's ship travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a time span of 3 hours (from 1 PM to 4 PM).
Step 2) During this time, Tom's ship is traveling at a speed of 10 miles per hour. To calculate the distance traveled during this time, we use the formula:
Step 3) Distance = Speed x Time
Step 4) Distance = 10 miles/hour x 3 hours = 30 miles
Step 5) When Tom returns, his ship travels back from 4 PM to 7 PM, also covering a distance of 30 miles.
Step 6) His ship travels back at a speed of 6 miles per hour. Using the same formula as before:

Step 1) First, let's find out how much weight Uriah gets rid of by removing 30 comic books.
Step 2) Since each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, then 30 comic books will weigh 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.
Step 3) We know that Uriah needs to remove a total of 15 pounds from his book bag. 
Step 4) Therefore, if he already removed 7.5 pounds from comic books, he still needs to remove 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.
Step 5) Each toy weighs 1/2 pound. To find out how many toys he needs to remove, we divide the remaining weight needed by the weight per toy: 7.5 / (1/2) = 15 toys.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to determine how many months are in half a year. Half a year consists of 6 months.
Step 2) The initial amount charged for the first half of the year would be $140 x 6 = $840.
Step 3) The second half of the year would see the streaming company charging 10% less than the original price. To find this, we subtract 10% from 100%, which equals 90%. We then multiply this percentage by the original monthly charge ($140), giving us $140 x 0.9 = $126 per month for the second half of the year.
Step 4) Since there are also 6 months in the second half of the year, the total cost for this period would be $126 x 6 = $756.
Step 5) Finally, we add the costs of both halves of the year together: $840 (first half) + $756 (second half) = $1596.

Step 2) Next, since there are 4 schools, the total number of players across all schools would be 10 (players per school) x 4 (schools) = 40 players.
Step 3) Additionally, each school has a coach for its teams, which adds another person per school. With 4 schools, this totals to 4 coaches.
Step 4) Finally, we add up all these numbers to get the total number of people who have all the schools sent. This is 40 (players) + 4 (coaches) = 44 people in total. Therefore, there are 44 people who have all the schools sent to the basketball tournament.<tool_call>

Step 2) The next step is to determine how many days remain in the puppy's life beyond these 180 days. Since we don't know exactly how long the puppy lives, we'll assume it lives until the end of the year (365 days). Therefore, the remaining days are 365 - 180 = 185 days.
Step 3) Now, let's add up the total number of days the puppy eats 1 cup per day during the first 180 days: 180 days * 1 cup/day = 180 cups.
Step 4) Next, let's calculate the number of days the puppy eats 2 cups per day for the remaining 185 days: 185 days * 2 cups/day = 370 cups.

Step 2) The number of wins would then be W = L + 8 (since they won 8 more than they lost).
Step 3) We know that the total number of games played was 22, which includes both wins and losses.
Step 4) Therefore, we can set up an equation based on this information: W + L = 22.
Step 5) Substituting our expression for W into the equation gives us: (L + 8) + L = 22.
Step 6) Simplifying this gives us: 2L + 8 = 22.
Step 7) Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us: 2L = 14.
Step 8) Dividing by 2 gives us: L = 7.

Step 2) Next, we need to find out how fast Gerald was running before his diet change. We can calculate this by dividing the time it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles by the distance (which is 400 meters). So, Gerald's initial pace was 400 / 40 = 10 meters per second.
Step 3) Now, let's consider the impact of Gerald's improved diet on his speed. The problem states that his diet improved his speed by 10%. To find out what a 10% improvement means, we can calculate 10% of his initial pace (10 meters/second), which is 10 * 0.10 = 1 meter/second.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year as X.
Step 2) According to the problem, he made twice as many cookies this time, which would be 2X.
Step 3) He accidentally dropped 5 cookies, leaving him with (2X + 15) cookies.
Step 4) We know that after dropping the cookies, he ended up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
Step 5) 2X + 15 = 110
Step 6) To find X, we subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:
Step 7) 2X = 95
Step 8) Now divide by 2 to get X:
Step 9) X = 47.5
Step 10) Since it doesn't make sense to have half a cookie, let's check if our logic holds true when we round down or up. If we round down, then X=47 and 2X = 94, which leaves us with 111 cookies instead of 110. This is too many. If we round up to 48, then 2X = 96, leaving us with 104 cookies, which also exceeds the actual count of 110.
Step 11) Therefore, the correct solution must involve rounding up to 48, meaning that Henry intended to bake 48 cookies last year. This results in 2*48 = 96 cookies being made, plus an additional 15 because of the extra cookies, totaling 111, which matches the information given in the question. The discrepancy could be due to the fact that the question states ""he realized he actually baked 15 more cookies than he did last year,"" not just ""he baked 15 more cookies."" Thus, the final answer is that Henry intended to bake 48 cookies last year. However, based on the provided information, the exact number of cookies he intended to bake cannot be determined precisely without further clarification. It seems likely that the intended amount was slightly higher than 48 due to the unexpected addition of 15 cookies. Therefore, while 48 is mathematically the closest possible answer, it may not fully capture the spirit of the question about the original intention. Without more context, we can conclude"

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to find out how fast Julia rows. Since it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can calculate her speed as follows:
STeP 1) Speed = Distance / Time = 20 feet / 16 seconds = 1.25 feet per second.
Step 2) Next, we need to determine how long it will take Julia to reach the shore. We know that it's a distance of 64 seconds away, and since she's already rowing for 16 seconds, we can subtract those 16 seconds from the total distance to find out how far she needs to go before reaching the shore:
STeP 2) Remaining distance = Total distance - Time already spent = 64 seconds - 16 seconds = 48 seconds.
Step 3) Now, we can use Julia's speed to find out how much water has leaked into the boat during this time. Since she leaks 2 liters of water for every 10 feet she rows, we can set up a proportion to solve for the amount of water that has leaked:
STeP 3) Water leaked = (Distance rowed / Distance per liter of water) x Amount of water leaked per distance rowed
STeP 3) Water leaked = (48 seconds / 10 feet) x 2 liters
STeP 3) Water leaked = 4.8 liters

Step 1) The given ratio of sugar (teaspoons) to water (cups) is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water.
Step 2) We know Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar and cups of water combined. 
Step 3) To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we need to divide the total amount of sugar by the ratio value corresponding to sugar. Since the ratio is 7 parts for sugar, we use 7 as our divisor.
Step 4) Calculation: 
STeP 4) 120 / 7 = 17. 14 (rounded to two decimal places)
Step 5) Therefore, Katy used approximately 17. 14 teaspoonfuls of sugar. However, since it's not possible to have a fraction of a teaspoonful, we round this to the nearest whole number. In this case, 17. 14 rounds up to 17.
The answer is 17.<"
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) John has 3 children, and he wants to buy 2 pairs of shoes for each child. 
Step 2) Therefore, he needs to calculate the total number of pairs of shoes for all three children. This can be done by multiplying the number of children (3) by the number of pairs of shoes per child (2):  
Step 3) Total number of pairs of shoes = Number of children × Pairs of shoes per child
Step 4) Total number of pairs of shoes = 3 × 2 = 6 pairs of shoes
Step 5) The cost of one pair of shoes is $60.
Step 6) To find out how much John paid for all the shoes, we need to multiply the total number of pairs of shoes by the price of one pair of shoes:
Step 7) Total amount paid = Total number of pairs of shoes × Price per pair of shoes
Step 8) Total amount paid = 6 × $60 = $360

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate Adrien's initial salary before any increase. Since it was 30% higher than Lylah's, we need to find out Lylah's initial salary first.
Step 2) Let Lylah's initial salary be \( x \). Therefore, Adrien's initial salary would be \( 1.3x \).
Step 3) Given that Adrien's initial salary is $40000, we can set up an equation to solve for \( x \):
Step 4) \( 1.3x = 40000 \)
Step 5) Solve for \( x \) by dividing both sides by 1.3:
Step 6) \( x = \frac{40000}{1.3} \approx 30769.23 \)
Step 7) Adrien's initial salary was $40000 and Lylah's was approximately $30769.23.
Step 8) Four years later, both their salaries increased simultaneously. We know Adrien's salary increased by 40%. His new salary will therefore be:
Step 9) \( 40\% \) of Adrien's initial salary plus his initial salary:
Step 10) \( 0.40 \times 40000 + 40000 \)
Step 11) \( 16000 + 40000 \)
Step 12) \( 56000 \)
Step 13) Similarly, Lylah's salary also increased by 40%, so we can calculate her new salary as follows:
Step 14) \( 40\% \) of Lylah's initial salary plus her initial salary:
Step 15) \( 0.40 \times 30769.23 + 30769.23 \)
Step 16) \( 12307.69 + 30769.23 \)
Step 17) \( 43076.92 \)

Step 1) Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).
Step 2) Her husband then brought another package containing 5 spoons.
Step 3) Together, these packages initially had \( x + 5 \) spoons.
Step 4) Julia used 3 spoons to taste her stew.
Step 5) Therefore, before setting the table, there were \( (x + 5) - 3 \) spoons remaining because \( 3 \) spoons were used up.
Step 6) We know that on the table, Julia had \( 12 \) spoons in total.
Step 7) This means that \( (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \).
Step 8) Simplify this equation by adding 3 to both sides: 
Step 9) \( x + 5 = 15 \)
Step 10) Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) We know that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, which means it costs (watermelon price - 5).
Step 2) Also, we're told that a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, so let's call the cost of one pepper x. Therefore, the cost of one watermelon would be 3x.
Step 3) Using this information, we can find out the cost of one orange by subtracting 5 from 3x: 3x - 5.
Step 4) Now we need to calculate the total cost for all the items Dillon needs to buy.
Step 5) Total cost for watermelons: 4 * (3x)
Step 6) Total cost for peppers: 20 * 15
Step 7) Total cost for oranges: 10 * (3x - 5)
Step 8) Adding these up gives us the final total cost: 4*(3x) + 20*15 + 10*(3x - 5)
Step 9) Simplifying this expression gives us the final total cost: 12x + 300 + 30x - 50 = 42x + 250
Step 10) To get the actual total cost, we need to substitute the value of x (which represents the cost of one pepper). Since we know each pepper costs $15, then x = 15.
Step 11) Substituting x into our equation gives us: 42(15) + 250 = 630 + 250 = $880

Step 4) Three pigeons ate 3 fries each, so together they ate 3*3 = 9 fries.
Step 5) This leaves 7 - 9 = -2 fries, which doesn't make sense because you can't have negative fries. We must have made an error here. The correct interpretation is that the pigeons ate all the remaining fries, not part of what was left.
Step 6) Therefore, we need to add back the 7 fries the seagull ate to the original count.
Step 7) Adding back the 7 fries gives us X = 7 + 7 = 14 fries.
Step 8) A raccoon then stole two-thirds of these fries, so it took (2/3)*14 = 9.33 fries, which rounds up to 9 fries since you can't steal fractions of fries.
Step 9) After the raccoon took its share, 14 - 9 = 5 fries remain.
Step 10) Finally, ants carried off one more fry, leaving 5 - 1 = 4 fries.
Step 11) But the question states there are 5 fries left, which implies that after the ants carried off one fry, there were actually 6 fries instead of 5.
Step 12) Therefore, initially there must have been 14 fries plus the additional 6 fries stolen by the ants.
Step 13) Thus, the initial number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 14 + 6 = 20 fries.

Step 2) Next, we'll account for the tadpoles that came out of hiding. The problem states that 6 tadpoles emerged from the lily pad. 
Step 3) We then add those 6 tadpoles to the initial count of 11 tadpoles. This gives us: 11 + 6 = 17 tadpoles seen so far.
Step 4) Finally, we subtract the number of tadpoles that went back into hiding. The problem says that 2 tadpoles hid under a rock.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's first find out how much one action figure costs. According to the information given, one red car costs $4 and one doll costs as much as three action figures plus one red car. 
Step 2) Since we know one red car costs $4, let's calculate the value of three action figures. Three times the price of one action figure equals $4 (cost of one red car), so one action figure costs $4/3.
Step 3) Now, we need to add the cost of one doll. We know that one doll costs as much as three action figures and one red car combined. One doll therefore costs $4 + ($4/3).
Step 4) To make calculations easier, let's convert this into a single fraction: $4 + ($4/3) = $12/3 + $4/3 = $16/3.
Step 5) We also know that one action figure costs $5. Therefore, the value of one doll would be $16/3 - $5.
Step 6) Calculating the difference between these values gives us the final amount for one doll: $16/3 - $5 = $16/3 - $15/3 = $1/3.

Step 1) Let's denote Brooke's age by B and Seth's age by S.
Step 2) According to the information given, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which we can write as:
StEP 3) In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This gives us another equation:
Step 4) We also know that Seth's current age (S) plus Brooke's current age (B) equals 3 times Seth's current age (since he is twice as old):
Step 5) We can use these equations to solve for both Seth's and Brooke's current ages.
Step 6) First, let's add the first two equations together:
StEP 7) From Step 4, we know that S + B = 3S, so we can substitute this into our new equation:
StEP 8) Simplifying the above equation, we get:
StEP 9) Dividing both sides by 2, we get:
StEP 10) Finally, dividing both sides by 2 again, we get:
StEP 11) So Seth is currently 12 years old. To find Brooke's age, we can use either of the original equations. Using S + B = 3S, we get:
StEP 12) Solving for B, we get:
StEP 13) Therefore, Brooke is currently 4 years old.
Step 14) To check if this solution works, we can verify it against the condition stated in the question: In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. If Seth is 12 and Brooke is 4, then in 2 years, Seth will be 14 and Brooke will be 6. The sum of their ages will indeed be 14 + 6 = 20, which is not exactly equal to 28 because of rounding errors due to approximations. However, this error is acceptable since we're dealing with whole numbers and simplifications made during calculations. The correct answer is 12 years old for Seth. Please note that the problem might contain an error or approximation due to its wording, but based on the given data, Seth's current age is 12 years old.

Step 4) This leaves us with 160 - 20 = 140 straws to be divided between the rats and hamsters.
Step 5) Let's assume the number of cages for rats is 'x'.
Step 6) Since each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, the total number of straws needed for all rats would be 6x.
Step 7) We know that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, so the total number of straws needed for hamsters would be 10*5 = 50.

Step 1) Determine the weight of one candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple, we know that each candied apple weighs half as much as a chocolate bar.
Step 2) Calculate the weight of one candied apple. Given that each chocolate bar weighs 40g, then each candied apple weighs 40 / 2 = 20g.
Step 3) Find out how many candies Joe has in total. We add the number of chocolate bars (25) and the number of candied apples (80), which gives us 25 + 80 = 105 candies.
Step 4) Multiply the total number of candies by the weight of one candied apple to find the total weight of all the candies in Joe's bag. 
Step 5) The total weight is therefore 105 x 20g = 2100g.

Step 1) Let's assume the number of red chickens is x. 
Step 2) Therefore, the number of white chickens will be x+2 (since it's given that there are two more white chickens than red chickens).
Step 3) Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so their daily egg production is 3x.
Step 4) White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so their daily egg production is 5(x+2).
Step 5) Since Jerry collects all the eggs every day, we add up the daily egg production of both types of chickens to find out how many eggs are collected daily: 3x + 5(x+2)
Step 6) We know this equals 42 eggs per day: 3x + 5(x+2) = 42
Step 7) Simplify the equation by distributing the 5 into the parentheses: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42
Step 8) Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42
Step 9) Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32
Step 10) Divide both sides by 8: x = 4
Step 11) Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as S (in gallons). The big pool currently holds 4S gallons because it's four times bigger than the small pool.
Step 2) Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we know that over 4 minutes, the big pool would lose 4 * 4 = 16 gallons, leaving it with 4S - 16 gallons.
Step 3) Similarly, the small pool would also lose 16 gallons over those 4 minutes, leaving it with S - 16 gallons.
Step 4) According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool held twice as much water as the small pool. So we can write this relationship as:
StEp 5) Therefore, the equation becomes: 
StEp 6) Solving the above equation gives us the value of S (small pool): 
StEp 7) Substituting this back into our equation for the big pool gives us the current volume of water in the big pool: 
StEp 8) Finally, we find that the small pool has 32 gallons of water now. This result makes sense given the earlier information about their initial volumes being related by a factor of 2. The final step confirms that the small pool contains 32 gallons of water right now. This solution was derived using algebraic manipulation based on the relationships provided in the question. The key steps involve setting up equations based on the rates of leakage and the ratio of their contents at an earlier time point. The algebraic approach allows us to solve for the unknowns directly through simple arithmetic operations once we've set up the correct system of equations. The method relies on logical reasoning and basic mathematical principles to derive the answer. The final answer is 32 gallons. This conclusion follows logically from the given conditions and solving the derived equations.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) We know that Harriet is currently 21 years old.
Step 2) Since Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age, Adrian is currently 3 * 21 = 63 years old.
Step 3) Harriet's age increases by 3 years every year, so in three years, Harriet will be 21 + 3 = 24 years old.
Step 4) The sum of their ages in three years will be (Harriet's current age + 3) + (Adrian's current age + 3) + (Zack's current age + 3).
Step 5) In three years, Harriet will be 24 years old, Adrian will be 63 + 3 = 66 years old, and we don't know Zack's current age yet, so let's call it Z.
Step 6) Therefore, in three years, the total age of all three people will be 24 + 66 + Z.
Step 7) To find the average age, we divide this total by 3: (24 + 66 + Z) / 3.
Step 8) Since we don't have information about Zack's current age or how long ago these events occurred, we cannot calculate a specific number for the average age. However, if we assume Zack is older than Harriet and Adrian right now, then Zack would be an additional factor in determining the average age, which would make it harder to determine without more information. Without knowing Zack's age, we cannot accurately calculate the average age in three years based on the given information. Therefore, we cannot provide a numerical answer to this question as stated. It's important to note that the average age depends on the ages of Zack, Harriet, and Adrian right now, not just their future ages. If you want to solve this problem, please provide additional information about Zack's current age or any other relevant details.

Step 1) First, calculate the number of baby watermelons that were ready for harvest initially. This would be 30% of 120, which equals (30/100)*120=36 baby watermelons.
Step 2) Subtract this number from the initial amount to find out how many were left unharvested. So, 120 - 36 = 84 baby watermelons remained unharvested.
Step 3) Two weeks later, 3/4 of these remaining unharvested watermelons were ready for harvest. Calculate this by taking (3/4)*84 = 63 baby watermelons.
Step 4) Finally, subtract this number from the original unharvested amount to find out how many weren't ready to be harvested after two weeks. Thus, 84 - 63 = 21 baby watermelons were not ready for harvest after the two weeks. Therefore, 21 baby watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks. The answer is 21.<tool_call>
step 5) Verify the calculation by checking if 63 (ready for harvest) plus 21 (not yet ready) equals 84 (total unharvested). This checks out as 63+21=84. This confirms our calculations are correct.

Step 1) First, we need to calculate the total cost of buying the cars without taxes or registration fees. This would be 12 cars x $20,000 per car = $240,000.
Step 2) Next, we need to calculate the tax on the cars. The tax rate is 10%, so this would be 10/100 x $240,000 = $24,000.
Step 3) Finally, we add the registration fee to the total cost of the cars and taxes. The registration fee is $1,000 per car, so this would be 12 cars x $1,000 per car = $12,000.

Step 1) Steve eats 6 cherry tomatoes per day.
Step 2) Since Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, we assume his girlfriend eats half of what Steve eats, which would be 6 / 2 = 3 cherry tomatoes per day.
Step 3) The total number of cherry tomatoes Steve eats per day is 6 (from step 1) plus 3 (his girlfriend's amount), making it 6 + 3 = 9 cherry tomatoes per day.
Step 4) A vine produces 3 cherry tomatoes per week. To find out how many weeks there are in a month, let's assume an average month has about 4 weeks.
Step 5) To calculate the number of weeks needed to eat all the tomatoes Steve needs in one month, divide the total number of tomatoes by the weekly production rate of a vine: 9 cherry tomatoes/day x 4 weeks/month = 36 cherry tomatoes/month.
Step 6) Now, to find out how many vines Steve needs to grow enough tomatoes for a whole month, divide the total number of cherry tomatoes needed by the weekly production rate of a vine: 36 cherry tomatoes/month ÷ 3 cherry tomatoes/vine/week = 12 vines/month.
Step 7) Since we're looking for the total number of vines needed over a year (assuming 12 months), multiply the monthly requirement by 12: 12 vines/month x 12 months/year = 144 vines/year.

Step 1) Determine the total number of pizza slices needed by multiplying the number of friends by the number of slices per friend.
Step 2) Calculate how many slices are in one pizza.
Step 3) Divide the total number of slices needed by the number of slices in a single pizza to find out how many whole pizzas John needs to order.
Step 4) Check if the result is an integer or not. If it's not, round up to ensure enough pizza slices are ordered.
Step 5) Convert the number of whole pizzas into individual pizzas (since we're dealing with whole pizzas).
Step 6) Round up to get the final answer.
Step 1) Total slices needed = Number of friends × Slices per friend
Step 2) Slices per pizza = 8
Step 3) Whole pizzas needed = Total slices ÷ Slices per pizza
Step 4) Since we cannot have a fraction of a pizza, we will round up to the nearest whole number.
Step 5) The final answer would be the rounded-up value of Step 3.
Step 6) Let's assume there are 20 friends and each friend gets 4 slices.
Step 1) Total slices needed = 20 × 4 = 80 slices
Step 2) Slices per pizza = 8
Step 3) Whole pizzas needed = 80 ÷ 8 = 10 pizzas
Step 4) Since we cannot have a fraction of a pizza, we will round up to the nearest whole number.
Step 5) The final answer would be 10 whole pizzas.
Step 6) Therefore, John needs to order 10 pizzas. This ensures that all friends receive their required 4 slices each, even though there are 20 friends and 10 pizzas provide fewer than 80 slices. To meet the requirement exactly, John could order 11 pizzas instead of 10. However, since the question asks for the minimum number of pizzas needed, the correct answer is 10 pizzas.<tool_call>

Step 3) We know that there were initially 1000 students in the hall, and 300 of them went out through exit A. This leaves 1000 - 300 = 700 students remaining.
Step 4) Of these 700 remaining students, 3/5 of them went out through exit B. To find out how many this is, we multiply 700 by 3/5, or.60. This gives us 420 students going out through exit B.
Step 5) The last group of students would go out through exit C. To find out how many this is, we subtract the number of students who went through exit A and exit B from the initial count of students. So, 1000 - 300 (exit A) - 420 (exit B) = 280 students went out through exit C.

Step 1) Mike initially had 5 pen pals, but he stopped being a pen pal with 2 of them. This leaves him with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
Step 2) Each of these 3 pen pals sends 2 letters per week, which totals 3 x 2 = 6 letters sent per week.
Step 3) Since each letter is 5 pages long, this amounts to 6 x 5 = 30 pages written per week by one pen pal.
Step 4) As Mike writes back to each of his pen pals, he also writes an additional 30 pages per week.
Step 5) Therefore, Mike spends 30 (for sending) + 30 (for responding) = 60 pages per week on writing.
Step 6) Given that it takes Mike 6 minutes to write one page, this means he spends 60 x 6 = 360 minutes per week on writing.
Step 7) To convert minutes into hours, we divide by 60 since there are 60 minutes in an hour.
