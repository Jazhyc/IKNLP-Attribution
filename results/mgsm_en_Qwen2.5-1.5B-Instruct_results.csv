Step 1) The problem states that a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
Step 2) It also says that a robe needs half as much white fiber as blue fiber. Since 2 bolts of blue fiber require 2/2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.
Step 3) To find out the total number of bolts needed for one robe, we add the number of blue fiber bolts (2) to the number of white fiber bolts (1).
Step 4) Therefore, a robe requires a total of 2 + 1 = 3 bolts of fabric.
The answer is 3 bolts."

THe ANSWER is 2 x Charleston's sheep count = 2 x 80 = 160 sheep. Therefore, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have a total of 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 sheep together."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate how long Carla normally would take to download the entire file without any interruptions.
The answeR is 200GB / 2GB per minute = 100 minutes or 1 hour and 40 minutes (since 60 minutes make an hour). But since 40% of the way through the download, we need to calculate this time as well. This means that 40% of 100 minutes is 40 minutes, leaving 60 minutes or 1 hour remaining until the full download is complete. Therefore, Carla will take 40 minutes + 60 minutes = 100 minutes to finish the download if there were no interruptions. However, because of the interruption, she needs to restart the download from the beginning. This means she'll have to add back the time taken for the restart, which is 20 minutes. Therefore, the total time to download the file is 100 minutes + 20 minutes = 120 minutes."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First calculate how far John drove initially by multiplying the time (3 hours) by the speed (60 mph):
Step 2) Next, determine the distance John traveled during the 2 hours stuck in traffic:
Step 3) Calculate the distance John traveled while driving at 30 mph for the next half hour:
Step 4) Finally, calculate the remaining time for him to travel at 80 mph to reach home within the 4-hour limit:
Step 5) Sum up all distances to find out where he is from home when he stops driving at 4 hours.
Step 1) Distance driven initially: 3 hours × 60 mph = 180 miles
Step 2) Distance driven in traffic: 2 hours × 0 mph = 0 miles
Step 3) Distance driven at 30 mph: 0.5 hours × 30 mph = 15 miles
Step 4) Remaining time: 4 hours - 2 hours - 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours
Step 5) Distance driven at 80 mph: 1.5 hours × 80 mph = 120 miles
Step 6) Total distance driven: 180 miles + 0 miles + 15 miles + 120 miles = 315 miles
Step 7) Since this exceeds the 300-mile limit, we need to check if he could have reached home earlier or not. We know he was halfway through his trip when he stopped, which would mean he covered half the distance:
Step 8) Halfway point: 300 miles / 2 = 150 miles
Step 9) Time taken to cover 150 miles at 80 mph: 150 miles / 80 mph = 1.875 hours ≈ 1.88 hours
Step 10) Subtracting this time from the 4-hour deadline gives us approximately 2.12 hours remaining:
Step 11) Using this remaining time, calculate how far he could have gone:
Step 12) Remaining distance: 4 hours × 80 mph = 320 miles
Step 13) Therefore, John is about 20 miles away from home when he stops at the 4-hour mark. This confirms our initial calculations as it shows"

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we know that the program had 60 downloads in the first month.
Step 2) In the second month, it had three times as many downloads as the first month, which would be 60 x 3 = 180 downloads.
Step 3) However, in the third month, the number of downloads decreased by 30%. To calculate this decrease, we take 30/100 x 180 = 54 downloads.
Step 4) Therefore, the number of downloads in the third month would be 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.
Step 5) To find out the total number of downloads over the three months, we add up all the downloads: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month).
Step 6) This gives us a total of 366 downloads over the three months.
The answer is 366."

Step 1) Calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
The answer is (20 x 20%) / 100 = 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. (This is because 20% of 20 is equal to 4, since percent means ""per hundred"" or out of one hundred.) So we know that there are 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance. Step 2) Calculate the number of students who didn't enroll in contemporary dance yet (therefore remaining): 20 students - 4 students = 16 students. Step 3) Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance: The 16 students minus the 20% of them (which is 25%) is equal to 16 - 16 x 25% / 100 = 16 - 4 = 12 students enrolled in jazz dance. Step 4) Calculate the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance: We know there are 20 students in total, and 4 are in contemporary dance and 12 are in jazz dance, so therefore there must be 20 - 4 - 12 = 4 students enrolled in hip-hop dance. Step 5) To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students in hip-hop by the total number of students and multiply it by 100: 4 / 20 x 100 = 20%. Therefore, 20% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's find out how long Marissa has already spent walking. She walked 4 miles in 1 hour and 2 miles in 1 hour, which totals 1+1=2 hours.
Step 2) Next, we'll calculate how far Marissa has walked so far. Since she has walked 4 miles plus 2 miles, she has covered a total of 4+2=6 miles.
Step 3) We know that Marissa wants an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire hike. This means that for every hour she walks, she needs to cover 4 miles.
Step 4) To find out how many miles Marissa still needs to walk, we subtract the miles she has already covered from the total distance of the hike: 12-6=6 miles.
Step 5) Finally, to find out how fast Marissa needs to walk to reach this new total distance in one hour, we divide the number of miles by the time it takes: 6/1=6 miles per hour.
The answer is 6 miles per hour."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's find out how much water was initially present in both drinks.
The answer is 20 liters (10 liters x 2/3 = 20 liters). The 15 liters of pineapple drink contains 9 liters of water (15 liters x 3/5 = 9 liters), making a total of 29 liters of water in the combined mixture (20 liters + 9 liters = 29 liters). This leaves us with 5 liters of juice in our initial mix (10 liters - 5 liters spilled = 5 liters). Step 2) Next, we need to figure out how much water will come from the orange drink once we pour it into the pineapple drink. We know that the orange drink has 2/3 water, so when mixed with the pineapple drink which also has 3/5 water, their water content will combine proportionally. Let X represent the amount of orange drink poured into the pineapple drink. The total volume of the mixture would then be X + 15 liters. Water percentage from orange drink: (2/3) / ((2/3) + (3/5)) = (2/3) / (29/15) = 2/3 * 15/29 = 10/29. Since we want to know what fraction of this mixture is made up of water, we multiply by the proportion of water in the orange drink: (10/29) * 10/29 = 100/841. The same goes for the pineapple drink; since it already has 3/5 of its volume being water, we just take 3/5 of 15 liters, or simply calculate (3/5) * 15 = 9 liters. Therefore, adding these amounts together gives us the total amount of water in the final mixture: 100/841 * (5 + 15) = 100/841 * 20 = 2000/841 ≈ 2.38 liters. So, approximately 2.38 liters of water are in the remaining 24 liters."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).
Step 2) The book is sold with a 25% discount on its original price. This means Kyle paid 75% (or 0.75 times) of the original price.
Step 3) We know that Kyle paid $19.50, which represents 75% of the original price (\( 0.75P \)).
Step 4) Therefore, we can set up the equation: \( 0.75P = \$19.50 \)
Step 5) To find the original price \( P \), we divide both sides by 0.75: \( P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \)
Step 6) Calculating this gives us \( P = \$26 \)
The answer is $26."

Step 1) Henry's total distance traveled on his bike trip is 60 miles.
Step 2) He made a first stop after 20 miles, which means he traveled 60 - 20 = 40 miles since his first stop.
Step 3) The second stop was 15 miles before the end of the trip, meaning it would be 60 - 15 = 45 miles away from the start point.
Step 4) To find out how far he traveled between his first and second stops, we subtract the distance of the first stop from the distance of the second stop: 45 miles (second stop) - 20 miles (first stop) = 25 miles.
The answer is 25 miles."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the price of the first pair of heels as H1 and the second pair of heels as H2. We know that H1 = $33.
Step 2) According to the problem statement, the second pair of heels (H2) costs twice as much as the first pair, so we can write it as: H2 = 2 * H1.
Step 3) Substituting the value of H1 into the equation above gives us: H2 = 2 * $33 = $66.
Step 4) The total cost of both pairs of heels is $33 + $66 = $99.
Step 5) We also know that the boots cost $5 more than the combined cost of the two pairs of heels, so the boot price is: Boots = $99 + $5 = $104.
Step 6) Therefore, the boots cost $104. Answer: $104.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let Darrell's age be represented by \(D\) and Allen's age be represented by \(A\).
Step 2) According to the given information, we know that \(D:A = 7:11\). This means that if we let the common multiple of 7 and 11 be \(k\), then \(D = 7k\) and \(A = 11k\).
Step 3) We also know that the sum of their ages is 162, so \(D + A = 162\).
Step 4) Substituting the expressions for \(D\) and \(A\) into the equation above, we get \(7k + 11k = 162\).
Step 5) Simplifying this gives us \(18k = 162\).
Step 6) Solving for \(k\), we find that \(k = \frac{162}{18} = 9\).
Step 7) Now that we have found \(k\), we can find the ages of both Darrell and Allen. 
Step 8) Since \(D = 7k\), Darrell's age would be \(7*9 = 63\).
Step 9) And since \(A = 11k\), Allen's age would be \(11*9 = 99\).
Step 10) Finally, to find out what Allen's age will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age, giving us \(99+10 = 109\).
The answer is 109."

Step 1) First, let's find out what the second friend guessed. Half of the first guess (80) is 40. The second friend said it was 20 more than this, which means he guessed 40 + 20 = 60 jelly beans.
Step 2) Next, we need to calculate the third friend's guess. This person said it was 25% more than the first guess (80). To find this percentage increase, we take 25% of 80 and add it to the original number: 
Step 2) 80 x 0.25 = 20
Step 2) 80 + 20 = 100
Step 2) Therefore, the third friend guessed 100 jelly beans.
Step 3) Now, let's find the average guess by adding up all three guesses and dividing by 3:
Step 3) (80 + 60 + 100) / 3 = 240 / 3 = 80

Step 1) Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \).
Step 2) According to the problem, there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins, which we can write as \( G = S + 30 \), where \( G \) represents the number of gold coins.
Step 3) The total number of coins (gold and silver) is given as 110. We know that the total number of coins is equal to the sum of the number of gold coins and silver coins. Therefore, we can write an equation: 
Step 4) \( S + G = 110 \)
Step 5) Substituting the value of \( G \) from Step 2 into this equation gives us:
Step 6) \( S + (S + 30) = 110 \)
Step 7) Simplifying the above expression gives us:
Step 8) \( 2S + 30 = 110 \)
Step 9) Subtracting 30 from both sides of the equation gives us:
Step 10) \( 2S = 80 \)
Step 11) Dividing by 2 on both sides gives us:
Step 12) \( S = 40 \)
Step 13) Now, substituting back into the original equation \( G = S + 30 \) gives us:
Step 14) \( G = 40 + 30 = 70 \)
Step 15) Hence, Gretchen has 70 gold coins. Therefore, the final answer is 70.<tool_call>

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days.
Step 2) Let's assume the time he spends running on the first day is T hours. 
Step 3) The second and third days he runs half as much time as the first day, which would be T/2 hours.
Step 4) Since he runs for the same amount of time each day, we know that the total time spent running per day is the sum of the times spent on each day. Therefore, T + T/2 + T/2 = 60/3 (since there are 7 days in a week)
Step 5) Simplifying this equation gives us 3T/2 = 20
Step 6) Solving for T gives us T = 40/3 or approximately 13. 33 hours.
Step 7) To find out how fast John runs, we divide the distance by the time it takes him to cover that distance. In this case, he covers 60 miles in 40/3 hours.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the number of candles Charlie can make with one pound of beeswax and a wick:
The answer is 10 candles per pound of beeswax and wick combination. Therefore, with 2 pounds (1 pound + 1 pound), he can make 10 x 2 = 20 candles. This matches the information given that he wants to make and sell 20 candles, so we don't need to adjust this calculation further based on the problem statement's assumption about making exactly 20 candles. However, it's important to note that the actual production could vary depending on other factors such as wax quality or quantity available, which isn't considered in this simplified scenario where he just needs to meet the target of selling 20 candles regardless of exact quantities produced. The key point here is that he indeed meets the requirement by producing 20 candles using 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks costing $10.00 in supplies, even though the exact numbers may differ in real-world scenarios due to potential variations in wax composition or availability."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First we need to calculate how many articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. Since she wrote 2/5 times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday, we can find this by multiplying Monday's count (5) by 2/5.
THe answer is 5 * 2 / 5 = 2 articles on Tuesday. (This means she wrote 2/5 of 5 which equals 2.) Step 2) Next we'll figure out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday. We know that she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, so we multiply Tuesday's count (2) by 2. The answer is 2 * 2 = 4 articles on Wednesday. Step 3) Finally, we add up all the articles written over the three days to get the total time spent writing them. We know that one article takes 4 hours to write, so we multiply the total number of articles written by 4. The answer is (5 + 2 + 4) * 4 = 3*4 = 12 hours in total."

Step 1) Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse.
Step 2) She then received an additional 23 post-it notes (since she had 23 remaining).
Step 3) This means she had a total of 80 + 23 = 103 post-it notes before purchasing the new package.
Step 4) We know that she used up all the original 80 post-it notes plus the 23 she had leftover, which equals 103 post-it notes.
Step 5) Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased must equal the difference between the total post-it notes she had before buying it (103) and the ones she already had (80), which is 103 - 80 = 23.
The answer is 23."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Determine the number of blue ties John bought.
The answer is 5 because 200 / (40/2) = 5 blue ties were purchased by John. This is calculated by dividing the total amount spent ($200) by the price per tie ($40), then multiplying by 2 since John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Therefore, we get 2 * 5 = 10 blue ties were purchased by John. However, this calculation seems incorrect based on the provided solution, which suggests John bought 5 blue ties instead. Let's correct this step accordingly. Step 2) Calculate the cost of one blue tie. Since John spent a total of $200 on blue ties and bought 5 blue ties, the cost of one blue tie is $200 / 5 = $40 per tie. Step 3) Calculate the cost of the red ties. As stated earlier, John bought twice as many red ties as blue ties. Thus, if John bought 5 blue ties, he would have bought 2 * 5 = 10 red ties. Step 4) Calculate the cost of all blue ties. With the cost of one blue tie being $40, the total cost of all blue ties is 5 * $40 = $200. Step 5) Calculate the cost of all red ties. Given that each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie, the cost of each red tie is $40 * 1.5 = $60. The total cost of all red ties is 10 * $60 = $600. Step 6) Add up the cost of both types of ties to find out the total amount spent on ties. Total cost = Cost of blue ties + Cost of red ties = $200 + $600 = $800. Therefore, John spent $800 on ties."

Step 1) Convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the length of each piece Tracy cuts is given in inches. Since there are 12 inches in one foot, 4 feet is equal to 4 x 12 = 48 inches.
Step 2) Now we know that each piece of wire is 6 inches long, and the total length of the wire is 48 inches. To find out how many pieces she obtained, we need to divide the total length by the length of each piece: 48 / 6 = 8.
Step 3) Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire.

Step 1) First, we need to calculate how many eggs are produced per day by all the chickens. Since there are 3 chickens producing 252 eggs per day, the total number of eggs produced per day is 3 * 252 = 756 eggs.
Step 2) Next, we need to convert this into dozens since Lloyd sells them for $2 per dozen. To do this, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 (since there are 12 eggs in a dozen): 756 / 12 = 63 dozens.
Step 3) Finally, we multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen to find out how much Lloyd makes per week: 63 * $2 = $126.
The answer is $126."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Tom sails from 1 PM to 4 PM, which is a duration of 4 hours (from 1 to 4).
Step 2) In this time period, he sails at 10 mph, covering a distance of 4 hours * 10 mph = 40 miles.
Step 3) The return trip covers the same distance of 40 miles, but at a slower speed of 6 mph.
Step 4) To find out how long it takes to cover 40 miles at 6 mph, we use the formula: time = distance / speed.
Step 5) Plugging in the values gives us: time = 40 miles / 6 mph = approximately 6.67 hours.
Step 6) Therefore, it takes Tom about 6.67 hours to return to point A from point B at 6 mph. This can also be expressed as 6 hours and 40 minutes (since.67 x 60 minutes ≈ 40 minutes). Thus, the total travel time for Tom's round trip is 6 hours and 40 minutes. 
The answer is 6 hours and 40 minutes."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's find out how much the comic books weigh before Uriah removes them.
Step 2) The weight of one comic book is given as 1/4 pound. Therefore, if Uriah removes 30 comic books, we calculate their total weight by multiplying this by the number of comic books removed:
Step 3) Total weight of comic books removed = 30 × (1/4) = 30/4 = 7.5 pounds
Step 4) Now, we know that Uriah wants to reduce the total weight of his book bag by 15 pounds. This leaves us with:
Step 5) Remaining weight after removing comic books = Original weight - Weight of comic books removed = 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds
Step 6) Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight of one toy to find out how many toys remain:
Step 7) Number of toys remaining = Remaining weight / Weight of one toy = 7.5 ÷ (1/2) = 7.5 × 2 = 15 toys
Step 8) Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to bring the total weight back down to 15 pounds. Since he already removed 30 comic books, which is more than needed, he doesn't actually need to remove any additional toys. He just needs to keep the number of comic books he currently has. So, no additional toys need to be removed. He would need to remove 0 more toys. However, if we assume he was asked about the calculation process and not specifically required to remove toys, then the answer remains that 0 additional toys need to be removed. But since the question asks ""how many"" and considering a typical scenario where he might want to remove all comic books first, then toys, the correct interpretation based on the provided information is that he needs to remove 0 additional toys. If the intent was to ask for the number of comic books or toys removed, then the answers would be different depending on those interpretations. In this case, the most accurate response is 0 additional toys must be removed. 
The answer is 0 additional toys must be removed."

Step 1) Calculate the earnings on Thursday:
THe answEr is (6*60)+(4*40)=360+160=520 dollars earned on Thursday by repairing 6 truck tires and 4 car tires. 520/40=$13 per hour of work done on a tire repair job. The mechanic worked 10 hours this week because 6+4=10. Therefore, the mechanic earned $13 x 10=$130 more than on Friday when the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires. Step 2) Calculate the earnings on Friday: Since the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires on Friday, he only charged $40 for the 12 car tires repaired. The answEr is 12*40=$480 earned on Friday. Step 3) Compare the earnings between the two days to find out how much more revenue was earned on the day with higher revenue.

Step 1) We know that the bridge can carry up to 5000 pounds.
Step 2) The combined weight of the driver and the empty truck is 3755 pounds.
Step 3) To find out how much weight the box fill can add to the truck, we need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's weight limit.
Step 4) Therefore, the remaining capacity on the bridge is 5000 - 3755 = 1245 pounds.
Step 5) Since each box weighs 15 pounds, we can divide the remaining capacity by the weight per box to find out how many boxes can fit.
Step 6) Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck is 1245 / 15 = 83 boxes.

Step 1) First, let's determine the number of teams each school has sent. Since there are four schools and each school sends one girls' and one boys' team along with a coach, each school has sent a total of 2 teams (girls' and boys') plus 1 coach. This makes it 3 participants per school (2 teams + 1 coach). Therefore, for 4 schools, we would have 4 schools * 3 participants/school = 12 participants from the teams alone.
Step 2) Next, we need to add the coaches to this count. As mentioned earlier, each school has sent 1 coach, which results in an additional 4 coaches being sent across all the schools.
Step 3) To find the total number of people who have all of the schools sent, we simply add the number of participants from the teams and the coaches together: 12 participants + 4 coaches = 16 people in total.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Round all prices to the nearest dollar:
The answer is $3 (rounded from $2.74), $2 (rounded from $1.87), and $2 (rounded from $2.12). This gives us the new prices: marigolds for $3 per pot, petunias for $2 per pot, and begonias for $2 per pot. Step 2) Calculate total revenue for each type of flower sold: The 12 pots of marigolds sold at $3 each would generate 12 * $3 = $36. The 9 pots of petunias sold at $2 each would generate 9 * $2 = $18. The 17 pots of begonias sold at $2 each would generate 17 * $2 = $34. Step 3) Add up the total revenue: $36 (marigolds) + $18 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $88. Therefore, Artie will make $88 if he sells 12 pots of marigolds, 9 pots of petunias, and 17 pots of begonias."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the number of days in the first 180 days:
The answer is 180 days / 365 days per year ≈ 0.4933 years or approximately 180 days * (1/365) = 0.4933 years * 365 days/year = 180 days * (1/365) ≈ 5.023 days/day. However, since we're looking at whole days, we'll round this up to 5 days because even if it's not an exact multiple of 365, you would need to account for all full weeks as well as any remaining days. This gives us 180 days * (1/365) ≈ 5 days/day * 180 days = 900 days. But remember, this was an approximation due to rounding; we'll calculate exactly using the actual numbers later on. Let's move forward by calculating the total amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days correctly. We know that for the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of food per day, so 1 cup/day * 180 days = 180 cups of food. Step 2) Calculate the number of days remaining in the year after the first 180 days. Since there are 365 days in a year, we subtract the first 180 days from the total to find out how many days remain: 365 days/year - 180 days = 185 days. Step 3) Determine the daily consumption during these remaining days. The puppy eats 2 cups of food every day for the remainder of its life, which is 185 days. Therefore, the daily consumption is 2 cups/day * 185 days = 370 cups/day. Step 4) Calculate the total amount of dog food required for the remaining days. Multiply the daily consumption by the number of days remaining: 370 cups/day * 185 days = 68,050 cups. Step 5) Add the amounts together to get the total consumption over the entire year: 180 cups (for the first 180 days) + 68,050 cups (for the remaining 18"

Step 3) 18 / 3 = 6 packages
Step 4) Next, let's calculate the cost of these 6 packages at the first option.
Step 5) At the first option, each package costs $2.50. So, for 6 packages, it would cost:
Step 6) 6 x $2.50 = $15.00
Step 7) Now, let's find out how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent needs instead.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the number of games they lost as L. According to the problem statement, the number of games they won (W) was 8 more than their losses. We know this relationship can be expressed mathematically as W = L + 8.
Step 2) The total number of games they played is 22, which includes both wins and losses. This gives us another equation: W + L = 22.
Step 3) Substitute the expression we found for W in Step 1 into the second equation: (L + 8) + L = 22.
Step 4) Simplify the equation by combining like terms: 2L + 8 = 22.
Step 5) Subtract 8 from both sides to isolate the term with L on one side: 2L = 14.
Step 6) Divide both sides by 2 to solve for L: L = 7.
Step 7) Knowing that L equals 7, substitute back into the first equation to find out how many they won: W = L + 8 = 7 + 8 = 15.
The answer is 15."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's determine how long the first alarm ringing lasted. It rang four times.
Step 2) Next, we need to calculate the duration of the second alarm ringing. Since it rang for three times longer than the first one, it would last 4 x 3 = 12 seconds.
Step 3) Finally, we'll find out how long the third alarm ringing lasted. Since it rang for half as long as the second one, it would last 12 / 2 = 6 seconds.
Step 4) To get the total number of rings, we add up the durations of all alarms ringing together: 
Step 5) 4 (first alarm) + 12 (second alarm) + 6 (third alarm) = 22 rings.
The answer is 22 rings."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Sylvie's current salary before any increase is $600 per month.
Step 2) Her salary will increase by 10% annually for five years, which means it increases by 10/100*$600=$60 per month.
Step 3) To find out her monthly salary after the first year, we add the yearly raise to her original monthly salary: 
STeP 4) $600/month + $60/month = $660/month
Step 5) We repeat this process for the next four years, adding an additional $60 to her monthly salary each year.
Step 6) In Year 2: $660/month + $60/month = $720/month
Step 7) In Year 3: $720/month + $60/month = $780/month
Step 8) In Year 4: $780/month + $60/month = $840/month
Step 9) In Year 5: $840/month + $60/month = $900/month
Step 10) At the end of Year 5, Sylvie's monthly salary will be $900.
Step 11) To find her annual salary after three more years (Year 8), we multiply her monthly salary by 12 months/year:
Step 12) $900/month x 12 months/year = $10,800/year
The answer is $10,800/year."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Determine how much potato salad one child eats. Since a child eats half as much as an adult, we divide the amount an adult eats by 2. 
The answer is 5 lbs (10 / 2 = 5). Step 2) Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all adults. We multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult eats. This gives us 20 adults * 10 lbs per adult = 200 lbs. Step 3) Calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all children. Again, we multiply the number of children by the amount each child eats. This gives us 5 children * 5 lbs per child = 25 lbs. Step 4) Add the amounts calculated in steps 2 and 3 to get the total amount of potato salad needed for all diners. 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs. The answer is 225 lbs."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to determine how long it took Lee to run the 400-meter hurdles before Gerald's diet change. Since Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald, we subtract those two seconds from Lee's time to find out how long it took Gerald to run the hurdles without any changes in diet.
The answer is 36 seconds (38 - 2 = 36 seconds). Step 2) Next, we calculate how much faster Gerald ran the hurdles due to his diet improvement. We know that his diet increased his speed by 10%, so we multiply his original time by 1.10 (which represents a 10% increase) to find out his new time without considering the difference between him and Lee's times again since we already accounted for Lee's initial advantage. However, we don't actually need this step because we're asked specifically about how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles given the information provided, not including Lee's initial advantage in their race times directly. Let's move forward with finding Gerald's improved time based on the given information without needing to consider Lee's time again. Step 3) To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we divide his original time by 1.10 (since the 10% increase is what we're looking for), giving us his new running time adjusted for the diet improvement. The calculation will look like this: Gerald's new time = Original time / 1.10 = 36 / 1.10 = approximately 32.73 seconds. Thus, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles at around 32.73 seconds."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the number of dogs as D, the number of cats as C, and the number of rabbits as R.
Step 2) We know that there are 60 dogs (D=60), and since there are two cats for every dog, we can calculate the number of cats as follows: C = 2*D = 2*60 = 120.
Step 3) The problem states that the number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. This can be represented by the equation: R = D + C - 12.
Step 4) Substituting the values of D and C into this equation gives us: R = 60 + 120 - 12 = 178.
Step 5) To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add up the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits: Total Pets = Dogs + Cats + Rabbits = 60 + 120 + 178 = 358.
The answer is 358."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the number of boys in the class:
The answeR is (2/5)*200=80 boys in the class. This is because 2 out of every 5 students are boys, and there are 200 students in total. To find out how many boys there are, you multiply the total number of students by the fraction representing the boys' percentage. In this case, it's 2/5 or 40% of the total student population, which equals 80 boys. You could also calculate it as follows: (2/5)*200=80 boys. Let's check our work using a calculator if needed, though we already know the calculation will result in an integer value since we're dealing with whole people. No need to use one unless asked specifically to verify calculations on a device. We'll continue with our solution without needing to confirm the calculation again here, as we've arrived at the right answer through logical reasoning above. Step 2) Calculate the number of girls in the class: The number of girls would be the total number of students minus the number of boys: 200-80=120 girls in the class. Step 3) Determine how many girls are in Girl Scout: It's stated that 2/3 of the girls are in Girl Scout. Therefore, the number of girls in Girl Scout is calculated as: (2/3)*120=80 girls in Girl Scout. Step 4) Find out how many girls are not in Girl Scout: Subtract the number of girls in Girl Scout from the total number of girls: 120-80=40 girls not in Girl Scout. Thus, there are 40 girls who are not in Girl Scout."

The answer is 2 x 40 = 80 potted plants (from the windows ledges). Adding the new ones she received yesterday gives us a total of 80 + 18 = 98 potted plants. This is the number of potted plants Mary will keep before giving any away to friends or family members. Let's move forward with this figure. Step 2) Next, we need to determine how many potted plants Mary will give away to friends and family members. Since she plans to give 1 potted plant per window ledge, she'll give away 40 potted plants. Subtracting these from the current total leaves us with 98 - 40 = 58 potted plants remaining.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's find out how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell. We know that this was 1/4 times more than the first friend. 
The answer is 20 + (1/4)*20 = 20+5 = 25 times the doorbell bell rang by the second friend. So the second friend pressed the doorbell 25 times. Let's call this number B2 for simplicity. Therefore, we have B2 = 25 times the doorbell ring by the second friend. Let's denote this as equation (1): B2 = 25 times the doorbell ring by the second friend. Step 2) Next, we need to calculate how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell. This is given as 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed the doorbell 60 times, the third friend would press it 60 + 10*60 = 60 + 600 = 660 times. Let's call this number B3 for simplicity. Therefore, we have B3 = 660 times the doorbell ring by the third friend. Let's denote this as equation (2): B3 = 660 times the doorbell ring by the third friend. Step 3) Finally, we need to add up all the numbers of times the doorbell rang. We have B1 = 20 times the doorbell ring by the first friend; B2 = 25 times the doorbell ring by the second friend; B3 = 660 times the doorbell ring by the third friend; and B4 = 60 times the doorbell ring by the fourth friend. Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings is: T = B1 + B2 + B3 + B4 = 20 + 25 + 660 + 60 = 765 times the doorbell ring."

Step 1) Poppy starts by placing a quarter (1/4) of the pieces on the board. 
The answer is 250 pieces (since 1000 x 1/4 = 250). This leaves 1000 - 250 = 750 pieces remaining on the board. Step 2) Her mom then adds a third (1/3) of these remaining pieces to the board. The number of pieces her mom adds is 750 x 1/3 = 250. Therefore, the total number of pieces on the board now is 250 (from step 1) + 250 (from step 2) = 500 pieces. Step 3) To find out how many pieces are left to be placed, we subtract the total number of pieces already on the board from the original amount of pieces. This gives us 1000 - 500 = 500 pieces. Therefore, there are 500 pieces left to be placed in the puzzle."

Step 1) Calculate the total time Frankie spent watching TV from Monday through Thursday.
The answeR is 1 hour + 1 hour + 1 hour + 30 minutes + 30 minutes + 1 hour + 1 hour = 6 hours (or 360 minutes). This matches the information given that he watched 7 hours of TV in all, which is 420 minutes (since 7 x 60 = 420). This leaves 360 - 420 = -60 minutes as the remaining time he could have used for the three shows on Wednesday, Thursday, and Friday. Since we know the total time was 7 hours or 420 minutes, let's subtract this from the remaining time to find out how much time he spent on Wednesday shows alone: 360 - 420 = -60 minutes. This negative number indicates an error because it exceeds the total available time. Therefore, we need to adjust our calculation to account for the fact that he couldn't possibly spend more than 360 minutes on Wednesday shows alone. The correct approach would be to add back the extra 60 minutes to account for the initial 420 minutes, leaving us with 420 - 60 = 360 minutes. Now, since each show on Wednesday lasted 30 minutes, we divide by 30 to find out how many shows he watched: 360 / 30 = 12 shows. However, since he watched two shows on Friday, we must subtract one of these shows from the count to get the correct number of shows he watched on Wednesday: 12 - 1 = 11 shows. The answer is 11 shows."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's assume that Henry intended to bake x number of cookies last year.
Step 2) According to the problem, he ended up baking twice as many cookies, which would be 2x.
Step 3) But it was found out that he actually baked 15 more cookies than planned, so we add those extra 15 to our equation: 2x + 15.
Step 4) As a result, he dropped 5 cookies on the way out to cool down, leaving him with (2x + 15) - 5 = 110 cookies.
Step 5) We can solve this equation by subtracting 15 from both sides and then dividing by 2 to find the value of x.
Step 6) This gives us: 2x = 110 - 15
Step 7) 2x = 95
Step 8) x = 95 / 2
Step 9) x = 47.5
Step 10) Since you can't bake half a cookie, let's round up or down based on whether the baker needs to make whole numbers of cookies. In most cases, people tend to round up when baking because if they don’t get enough cookies, they may not have enough for their guests. Therefore, rounding up results in 48 cookies being the closest possible integer solution.
The answer is 48."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to determine the rate at which the boat is leaking water. We know it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so let's calculate the speed (in feet per second):
The answer is 16/20 = 0.8 feet per second. Since this is not possible, let's recheck our understanding. Let's assume it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so the speed would actually be 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second. This makes sense because the boat needs to cover 20 feet in 16 seconds, meaning it rows faster than its leak rate of 2 liters for every 10 feet, indicating the leak is affecting the boat's progress rather than slowing it down. Therefore, the boat is effectively losing water as it rows, even though it appears to be moving forward due to propulsion. However, since the question asks specifically about the amount of water that has leaked onto the boat, we'll focus on the leak rate given directly: 2 liters for every 10 feet of rowing. To find out how much water has accumulated over the journey, we multiply the number of leaks by the volume of water per leak and then by the time spent rowing. Since the problem doesn't specify the exact distance or duration, we can infer that the leakage occurs continuously throughout the journey, so we just use the provided information about the leak rate and the time taken. Thus, if the boat is leaking at 2 liters per 10 feet, and it travels 20 feet (the same distance as initially stated), the total leakage will be calculated as follows: 2 liters * (20 / 10) = 4 liters. Therefore, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has taken on an additional 4 liters of water."

Step 1) First, we need to find out how many photographs Jamal's phone can hold compared to Brittany's phone. We know that Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone. 
Step 2) Since Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, we can set up an equation to find out how many photographs Brittany's phone can hold:
Step 3) Let x represent the number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold. 
Step 4) According to the information given, x = (number of photographs Jamal's phone can hold / 6)
Step 5) Substituting the value of Jamal's phone's capacity into the equation, we get:
Step 6) x = (1800 / 6) = 300
Step 7) Therefore, Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.
Step 8) Next, we need to determine how many birds are in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. This information isn't provided directly, but it can be inferred from the fact that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph. 
Step 9) So if Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs, then the number of birds in Jamal's photograph must be 300/50 = 6 birds.
The answer is 6 birds."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) The given ratio of sugar to water is 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, Katy uses 13 cups of water.
Step 2) We know that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar (and consequently, 120/7 = 17. 14 cups of water).
Step 3) To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar she used, we need to convert the total amount of sugar into teaspoons. Since there are 7 teaspoons of sugar per cup of water, we multiply 17. 14 by 7 to get the total amount of sugar in teaspoons.
Step 4) 17. 14 x 7 = 120. 0 teaspoons of sugar.
Step 5) Therefore, Katy used 120 teaspoonfuls of sugar. (Note: In real-life scenarios, you cannot use a fraction of a teaspoonful, so it would likely be rounded up or down depending on the context.)

The answer is 2 x 5 = 10 vehicles (since there are 2 containers and each container has 5 vehicles inside). This brings us up to a total of 10 vehicles (from the first day) + 30 total vehicles = 40 vehicles at the port by the end of the second day. Thus, this implies that 40 - 10 = 30 vehicles came into the port on the second day. Since each container holds 5 vehicles, the number of containers would be 30 / 5 = 6 containers. Therefore, 6 containers were imported on the second day."

Step 1) Sadie initially slept 8 hours on Monday.
Step 2) For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which would be 8 - 2 = 6 hours per day.
Step 3) Since these days are consecutive, we need to add up their hours: 6 (Tuesday) + 6 (Wednesday) = 12 hours.
Step 4) The rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than what she slept during Tuesday and Wednesday combined, which is 12 + 1 = 13 hours.
Step 5) To find out the total number of hours she slept throughout the week, we sum up all the hours: 8 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday and Wednesday) + 13 (rest of the week) = 33 hours.
The answer is 33 hours."

Step 1) Let's denote the number of spoons in the package that Julia bought as \( x \).
Step 2) Her husband then brought another package containing 5 new spoons and gave them to Julia.
Step 3) Julia initially had 3 spoons before buying any new ones, and later she used 3 spoons to sample her stew. Therefore, the equation representing this situation would be:
Step 4) The initial amount of spoons plus the spoons given by her husband minus the spoons used to make the stew equals the total number of spoons on the table.
Step 5) This gives us the equation: 
Step 6) \( 3 + (x + 5) - 3 = 12 \)
Step 7) Simplifying this equation:
Step 8) \( 3 + x + 5 - 3 = 12 \)
Step 9) Combine like terms: \( x + 5 = 12 \)
Step 10) Subtract 5 from both sides to solve for \( x \):
Step 11) \( x = 12 - 5 \)
Step 12) \( x = 7 \)
Step 13) Thus, there were 7 spoons in the package that Julia bought.
The answer is 7."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to find out the cost of one pepper, which is given as $15 per pepper.
Step 2) Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, then one watermelon would cost 3 * $15 = $45.
Step 3) We also know that an orange costs $5 less than a watermelon, so one orange would cost $45 - $5 = $40.
Step 4) Now let's calculate the total cost for all the items Dillon needs to buy:
The answer is 4 * $45 (for watermelons) + 20 * $15 (for peppers) + 10 * $40 (for oranges) = $180 + $300 + $400 = $880."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the number of hours spent on all patients:
The answEr Is 500/24= 20. 67 hours (rounded up to 21 hours since you can't have a fraction of an hour here). This assumes no breaks or overlapping times between appointments which might not be true in real life but it's a reasonable estimate given the information provided. However, we'll keep it as 21 hours for our calculation. Therefore, the total time spent by all patients is 21*24= 504 minutes which equals 8. 4 hours. But this seems unrealistic because if everyone was seen simultaneously then it would take less than one hour per person. It's probably meant to be 24 minutes instead of 8. 4 hours. So let's correct it to 24 minutes per appointment, making the total time spent 500/24*24= 500 hours. This makes sense as it represents the actual amount of time needed to see all patients without any overlaps. Thus, the total time spent is 500*24= 12000 minutes, which is equivalent to 20 hours. Step 2) Calculate the revenue generated from seeing all patients: Since each patient pays $200/hour and there are 20 hours of service, the total revenue is 200*20= $4000. Step 3) Calculate the cost incurred by the hospital for running the facility during these hours: Since each doctor works for 8 hours, the total cost for all doctors combined is 8*150= $1200. Therefore, the total cost for the hospital is 1200+150= $1350. Step 4) Calculate the profit made by the hospital: Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs, i.e., $4000-$1350=$2650. Hence, the hospital makes a profit of $2650 from these visits."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's denote the number of queens as Q. According to the problem statement, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we can say there are 2Q baby bees.
Step 2) There are also twice as many worker bees as baby bees, so we can say there are 2(2Q) = 4Q worker bees.
Step 3) We know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700. Therefore, we can write an equation to represent this situation: 
Step 4) Number of queens (Q) + Number of baby bees (2Q) + Number of worker bees (4Q) = Total number of bees (700)
Step 5) Substituting our expressions from Step 2 into Step 4 gives us: 
Step 6) Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700
Step 7) Simplifying the expression on the left side by combining like terms gives us: 
Step 8) 7Q = 700
Step 9) Dividing both sides of the equation by 7 gives us: 
Step 10) Q = 100
Step 11) Since the question asks for the number of worker bees, which is 4 times the number of queens, we multiply the number of queens by 4: 
Step 12) Worker bees = 4 * 100 = 400
The answer is 400."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to determine how many bees left the hive in the second set of observations. Since this was half the number seen leaving in the first observation (30 bees), we calculate it as follows:
Step 2) 30 / 2 = 15 bees returning
Step 3) Next, we need to figure out how many bees left the hive initially. We know this is twice the number of bees that returned, so:
Step 4) 15 x 2 = 30 bees initially leaving
Step 5) Finally, we add up all the bees that left the hive during these periods:
Step 6) 30 (initially leaving) + 15 (returning back) + 30 (re-entering) = 75 bees total
Step 7) Therefore, the number of bees that Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 30. This is because those 30 bees represent all the initial bees that didn't return when they re-entered. The other 45 were either returned by bees coming into the hive or never left in the first place. However, since the question specifically asks about the returnees, the answer is 30. Please note that I made an error in my previous response; the correct answer is actually 30, not 75, as previously stated. The 30 bees are those that came back after initially leaving, not the total number of bees that left. Therefore, the correct answer is 30. Thank you for bringing this to my attention. I apologize for any confusion caused by my mistake earlier. I appreciate your patience and understanding. Let me know if you need anything else. I'm here to help! 🐝😊

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's calculate the number of bananas needed by the monkeys in one month.
The answer is 200 bananas (for the monkeys) / 1 month = 200 bananas per monkey per month. Since there are 10 monkeys, we multiply this by 10 to get the total number of bananas for monkeys in one month, which is 200 bananas x 10 monkeys = 2,000 bananas for monkeys in one month. In two months, this will increase by another 2,000 bananas, giving us a total of 4,000 bananas for monkeys in two months. Therefore, the total number of bananas needed for monkeys over two months is 4,000 bananas + 4,000 bananas = 8,000 bananas. Step 2) Next, let's calculate the number of bananas needed by the gorillas in one month. The gorillas need 400 bananas every month, regardless of time. Therefore, in two months, the gorillas will need 400 bananas x 2 months = 800 bananas. Step 3) Finally, let's calculate the number of bananas needed by the baboons in one month. They need 100 bananas per month. In two months, they will need 100 bananas x 2 months = 200 bananas. Adding up the needs for the monkeys, gorillas, and baboons, we get 8,000 bananas + 800 bananas + 200 bananas = 9,000 bananas. Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 9,000 bananas to feed all the apes for two months."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to calculate how far Blake ran. 
Step 2) Since Blake runs back and forth 15 times, he runs twice as far as one round (since he goes both ways). Therefore, he runs 15 x 2 = 30 rounds.
Step 3) The distance for one round is 100 yards, so the total distance for Blake is 30 x 100 = 3000 yards.
Step 4) Next, let's calculate how far Kelly ran.
Step 5) Kelly runs back and forth 34 times. Again, since she runs both ways, she covers 2 x 34 = 68 rounds.
Step 6) The distance for one round is 100 yards, so the total distance for Kelly is 68 x 100 = 6800 yards.
Step 7) Finally, we need to compare the distances covered by Blake and Kelly to find out how much farther the winner ran than the loser.
Step 8) Kelly ran 6800 yards, while Blake ran 3000 yards. The difference is 6800 - 3000 = 3800 yards.
Step 9) Therefore, the winner (Kelly) ran 3800 yards farther than the loser (Blake).

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to calculate the increase in price per two months. The problem states that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months. Since the original price was $20, the increase would be 20% of $20 which equals to $4 (because 20/100 * $20 = $4).
Step 2) Next, we will find out what the price would be after one year (which is two periods of two months). We start with the original price of $20 and add the monthly increase of $4. Therefore, after one year, the price would be $20 + ($4 x 6) = $20 + $24 = $44.
Step 3) Finally, since three years is equivalent to six periods of two months, we need to multiply the final price after one year by this factor. Thus, the price after three years would be $44 x 6 = $264.
The answer is $264."

The answer is 5."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's assume Brooke's age right now is x.
Step 2) Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's age would be 2x.
Step 3) In 2 years, Brooke's age would be x+2 and Seth's age would be 2x+2.
Step 4) The problem states that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, which gives us an equation: (x+2) + (2x+2) = 28.
Step 5) Simplify the equation: 3x + 4 = 28.
Step 6) Subtract 4 from both sides: 3x = 24.
Step 7) Divide by 3 on both sides: x = 8.
Step 8) Therefore, Brooke is currently 8 years old.
Step 9) Seth's current age is twice Brooke's age, so Seth is 2 * 8 = 16 years old.
The answer is Seth is 16 years old."

Step 1) We know that Sally Forty-two is 8 years old.
Step 2) Since Sally Forty-two is the same age as Sally Thirtwo, we can conclude that Sally Thirtwo is also 8 years old.
Step 3) Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four, which means Granny Red is 8 x 2 = 16 years old.
Step 4) Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, so Sally Two is 16 + 3 = 19 years old.
Step 5) The question asks for the total age of the four birds, which includes Sally Forty-two (8), Sally Thirtwo (8), Granny Red (16), and Sally Two (19).

Step 1) First, let's calculate the amount Jessica would pay if she paid the minimums for each debt.
The answer is $300 (student loan) + $200 (credit card) + $500 (mortgage) = $1,000 per month as the minimum payments combined. To find out what 50% more than this is, we multiply by 1.5: $1,000 x 1.5 = $1,500 per month for paying 50% over the minimums. Step 2) Since there are 12 months in a year, we need to multiply this number by 12 to get the annual amount: $1,500 x 12 = $18,000 per year. The answer is $18,000."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First we need to calculate how many minutes it will take Billy to peel all the potatoes. Since it takes him 1.5 minutes per potato, we multiply this by the number of potatoes (60):
Step 2) 1.5 minutes/potato x 60 potatoes = 90 minutes
Step 3) Next, we'll convert this time into hours since it seems like it would make sense for people to know when they're getting home from work or school. We divide the total minutes by 60:
Step 4) 90 minutes / 60 = 1.5 hours
Step 5) Finally, we add the time it takes to cut up each potato (which is just over 5 seconds). This is equal to 5/60 =.0833 hours.
Step 6) 1.5 hours +.0833 hours = 1.5833 hours
Step 7) Converting back to minutes gives us approximately 95 minutes.
The answer is approximately 95 minutes."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the revenue generated by selling all the lemonade:
The answEr is 20 x $0.50 = $10.00 per gallon of lemonade sold. Since they made a total of $25 in profit, this means they sold enough lemonade to earn $25 / $10.00 per gallon = 2.5 gallons. However, since you cannot sell half a gallon, we'll round down to 2 gallons because they don't make a full gallon unless they sell both their own and another's worth of lemonade. Thus, they must have sold 2 gallons of lemonade to generate $20 (since 2 gallons x $10.00 = $20.00). This means they made $20 in sales revenue, which equals $20 in earnings minus the cost of ingredients. Therefore, they spent $20 / 2 = $10 on lemons."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to find out how many Chinese people were in the race. We know that there were 240 participants in total, and 80 of them were Japanese. Therefore, the remaining participants must be Chinese.
Step 2) To calculate this, subtract the number of Japanese from the total number of participants:
Step 2) Total participants - Japanese participants = Chinese participants
Step 2) 240 - 80 = 160 Chinese participants
Step 3) Now, we're told that 60 boys participated on the Chinese team. Since all participants are either boys or girls, this means that the remaining participants (the girls) make up the difference between the total Chinese participants and the number of boys.
Step 4) To find the number of girls, subtract the number of boys from the total Chinese participants:
Step 4) Total Chinese participants - Number of boys = Number of girls
Step 4) 160 - 60 = 100 Girls
The answer is 100 girls."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the amount spent on rent and car fuel.
The answer is (1/4)*6000 = $1500 for rent and (1/3)*6000 = $2000 for car fuel. Total spent on rent and car fuel is 1500+2000 = $3500. Remaining amount after paying rent and car fuel is 6000 - 3500 = $2500. Step 2) Calculate the donation to charity. The amount donated to charity is 1/2*2500 = $1250. Remaining amount after donating to charity is 2500 - 1250 = $1250. Step 3) Subtract the amounts given to daughter and wife. Zaid gives his daughter $200 and his wife $700. Total given to daughter and wife is 200+700 = $900. Amount remaining after giving to daughter and wife is 1250 - 900 = $350. Therefore, Zaid will still have $350 after all these expenses and donations."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Let's define variables to represent the quantities of different flowers. Let x be the number of white carnations Sandra ordered initially.
Step 2) According to the information given, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so we can write this as 4x red roses.
Step 3) We know that Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which was five times the number of white carnations. This gives us another equation: 5x = 200.
Step 4) Solving for x, we get x = 200 / 5 = 40. Therefore, Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.
Step 5) Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, we can calculate the number of red roses as follows: 4x = 4 * 40 = 160.
Step 6) Therefore, Sandra must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to avoid switching suppliers. This will keep her business. The final answer is 160 red roses.</tool_call>
step 7) It's important to note that the problem asks for ""how many red roses"" Sandra must deliver by 5 pm, not just the quantity, because it states that Sandra is threatening to switch suppliers if the missing red roses are not delivered on time. In this case, delivering all 160 red roses would prevent a potential supplier switch. However, without additional context about whether any other deliveries might be missed or not made, it's not possible to determine exactly what Fred needs to deliver to meet Sandra's requirements beyond ensuring the minimum specified amount (160). But based on the information provided, the answer remains 160 red roses. The actual scenario could involve checking against other orders or verifying that no other deliveries need to be fulfilled before the deadline to ensure Sandra's business isn't impacted. If you're looking for specific numbers related to these calculations, please let me know! I'd be happy to help with those details too. But remember, the primary concern here is making sure Sandra doesn't lose her business due to late deliveries, regardless of the exact count of other items involved. Thank you for your patience!

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to find out Mark's current age.
Step 2) We know that Jan is currently 30 years old. 
Step 3) We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age.
Step 4) Let's call Jean's current age J.
Step 5) Two years ago, Jean's age would have been J - 2.
Step 6) Half of Jean's age two years ago would be (J - 2)/2.
Step 7) Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than this value, so Mark's age two years ago would be ((J - 2)/2) + 5.
Step 8) Since we know that Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age two years ago, we can set up an equation: ((J - 2)/2) + 5 = J/2 + 5.
Step 9) Simplifying the equation, we get: J/2 = J/2.
Step 10) This means that Jean's age must be equal to the number we just calculated earlier.
Step 11) Therefore, Jean is currently 35 years old.
Step 12) To confirm, let's check if it fits all conditions:
Step 13) Two years ago, Jean would have been 35 - 2 = 33 years old.
Step 14) Half of Jean's age two years ago would be 33 / 2 = 16.5 years old.
Step 15) Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than this value, so Mark was 16.5 + 5 = 21.5 years old.
Step 16) This matches our assumption since Jean is two years older than Mark, making Mark 20 years old and Jean 22 years old.
Step 17) Thus, Jean is indeed 35 years old. The final answer is Jean is 35 years old. I hope this explanation helps you understand the problem better! Let me know if you have any questions or need further clarification. I'm here to help! 😊👍

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the time it takes for the faster team (with all runners running at the same speed):
The answer is 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds per lap for the fastest team's runners. Since there are 4 laps in a full relay race, the fastest team would take 4 x 220 seconds = 880 seconds to complete the race. This is because each team member runs one lap, and there are four team members in the race. Therefore, the entire race lasts 4 x 55 seconds = 220 seconds per lap for the slower team's runners. Since there are 4 laps in a full relay race, the slower team would take 4 x 220 seconds = 880 seconds to complete the race."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's find out what Jerry needs to roll to get a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The possible outcomes here are 4, 5, or 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.
Step 2) Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling an even number on a six-sided die. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. So, there are 3 favorable outcomes.
Step 3) To roll two even numbers in a row, Jerry would need to roll an even number first and then another even number. The probability of this happening would be the product of the individual probabilities, which is (3/6)*(2/6) = 1/2.
Step 4) We want to compare these probabilities. Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = 3/6 = 1/2.
Step 5) Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = 1/2.
Step 6) The difference between these probabilities is zero since both equal 1/2.
Step 7) Since the difference is zero, the question becomes meaningless when expressed as a percentage because percentages cannot be calculated from zero differences.
The answer is that the problem statement seems to be contradictory, and therefore, it cannot be answered accurately as requested."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to find out how many rats Russell has distributed straws for. We know that 160 pieces of straw were distributed, and each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. So, we divide 160 by 6 to get the number of rats:
Step 2) 160 / 6 = 26.666...
Step 3) Since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we round this up to 27 rats (since you can't have less than one rat).
Step 4) Now we know there are 27 rats in total.
Step 5) We're told that these rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups. To find out how many rats are in each cage, we divide the total number of rats by the number of cages:
Step 6) 27 / 3 = 9
Step 7) Therefore, there are 9 rats in each cage.

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the amount of interest Mandy's debt will accrue over 3 months with a 2% annual interest rate. 
The answer is (100 x 2/100) x 3 = $6.00 per month or $18.00 in total over 3 months. This is because the interest accumulates monthly, not annually, so we need to multiply by the number of months and then divide by 100 to convert to a percentage form. Since we're looking at an annual interest rate, we'll keep the denominator as 100 to maintain consistency with the initial problem statement. The interest on the principal amount is calculated as follows: 100 x 2/100 = 2%, which represents the increase in value due to interest. We then multiply this interest rate by the time period (in years), which in this case is 3 months (or 1/4 year). Finally, we multiply this result by the principal amount ($100): 2% x 1/4 = 5% of the original amount, which equals $5. Therefore, the total interest accumulated over 3 months is $5.00. Adding this interest to the original principal amount gives us the total amount owed after 3 months: $100 + $5 = $105.00. This is the final amount Mandy would owe Benedict after 3 months if no further payment was made."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's calculate the total amount spent on the tickets.
The answer is $4.50 (given). Since this is the difference between what was spent on food and tickets, we can assume it represents the total extra spending on food compared to tickets. Therefore, the cost of the tickets would be $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. This is because if you subtract the additional $4.50 spent on food, the remaining $20.25 is distributed equally across the three tickets, making each ticket cost $15.75 / 3 = $5.25 each. However, since the question asks about the cost per person, and assuming the problem intends to divide the actual total spend by the number of people rather than just the ticket price, the calculation becomes simpler as follows: Total spend divided by the number of people equals the cost per person. Total spend is $20.25 (tickets) + $4.50 (food) = $24.75. Dividing by 3 gives us $24.75 / 3 = $8.25 per person. Thus, each friend paid $8.25."

Step 1) First, we need to find out how many sentences Mark edits for each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences for both publishers, let's call this number ""x"". We know that x + x = 1000 sentences because he edits a total of 1000 sentences each week. This simplifies to 2x = 1000. Solving for x gives us x = 500 sentences per week for each publisher.
Step 2) Next, we need to calculate how much Mark makes for each publisher. Since Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, he would earn 500 * 5 = 2500 cents (or $25) for editing for Publisher A.
Step 3) The problem states that Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A. Therefore, Publisher B would pay him 2 * 2500 = 5000 cents (or $50) for editing for Publisher B.
Step 4) To find out how much Mark makes in a week overall, we add up the earnings from both publishers: 2500 cents (for Publisher A) + 5000 cents (for Publisher B) = 7500 cents or $75.
The answer is 7500 cents or $75."

Step 1) Calculate the number of blue pens Janet bought:
The answer is 6 bags * 9 pens/bag = 54 blue pens. (since each bag contains 9 pens and she bought 6 bags of them). So, the total number of blue pens is 54 pens. (adding all the blue pens together, we get 54 pens as the final count of blue pens.) Step 2) Calculate the number of red pens Janet bought: The answer is 2 bags * 6 pens/bag = 12 red pens. (since each bag contains 6 pens and she bought 2 bags of them). So, the total number of red pens is 12 pens. (adding all the red pens together, we get 12 pens as the final count of red pens.) Step 3) Add up all the pens Janet has: Green pens = 22 pens; Blue pens = 54 pens; Red pens = 12 pens. Total pens = 22 + 54 + 12 = 88 pens. Therefore, Janet has a total of 88 pens."

The answer is 5 x 25 = 125 km per week. So in total, over those four weeks, he cycled 125 x 4 = 500 km. Step 2) Next calculate the distance Micheal cycled during the next three weeks (after deciding to reduce the number of rides to twice a week): The answer is 2 x 60 = 120 km per week. So in total, over those three weeks, he cycled 120 x 3 = 360 km. Step 3) Finally add up all the distances to get the total amount Micheal cycled: 500 km + 360 km = 860 km. Answer: Micheal cycled a total of 860 km."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) Calculate the weight of one chocolate bar: 
The answer is 40g (given in the problem statement). Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, we multiply this by 2: 40g x 2 = 80g per chocolate bar. This confirms the information given in the problem statement about the weights of the candies. We don't need to use it again because we already know the weight of a chocolate bar is 40g. However, if you want to double-check, we would calculate the weight of an apple first and then multiply it by 2 to get the weight of a chocolate bar. But since the question asks for the weight of the candy bags, not individual items, we can skip this step and move on to the next part of the calculation. The problem states that ""each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple,"" which is consistent with our previous calculations. We're told that there are 25 chocolate bars and 80 candied apples. To find the total weight, we'll add these together. Step 2) Calculate the total weight of all the candy bars and apples: Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples = Total weight of candy. Weight of chocolate bars = Number of chocolate bars x Weight of one chocolate bar = 25 x 40g = 1000g. Weight of candied apples = Number of candied apples x Weight of one candied apple. Let's call the weight of one candied apple 'x'. So, the equation becomes: 80x = 800g. Solving for 'x', we divide both sides by 80: x = 800g / 80 = 10g. Therefore, the weight of one candied apple is 10g. Now, let's solve for the total weight of the candied apples: Weight of candied apples = 80 x 10g = 800g. Adding this to the weight of the chocolate bars gives us: Total weight of candy = Weight of chocolate bars + Weight of candied apples = 1000g + 800g = 1800g. So, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 1800 grams."

Step 1) Calculate the number of cakes Rose bought on Tuesday. Since she bought three times as many cakes as she did on Monday, we multiply the number of cakes from Monday by 3:
THe answer is 12 cakes on Tuesday (because 4 x 3 = 12). Step 2) Next, calculate the number of cakes Rose bought on Wednesday. Since she bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday, we multiply the number of cakes from Tuesday by 5: The answer is 60 cakes on Wednesday (because 12 x 5 = 60). Step 3) Finally, add up the number of cakes bought over the three days to get the total: 4 (Monday) + 12 (Tuesday) + 60 (Wednesday) = 76 cakes. The answer is 76 cakes altogether."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, we need to determine the cost of one dozen cups.
Step 2) We know that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates at $6000 each.
Step 3) Half a dozen plates is equal to 6 plates (since 1 dozen equals 12 plates).
Step 4) Therefore, half a dozen plates costs $6000 * 6 = $36000.
Step 5) Subtracting the $1200 difference from this amount gives us the price of twenty dozen cups: $36000 - $1200 = $34800.
Step 6) To find out the cost of one dozen cups, divide the total cost by the number of dozens: $34800 / 20 = $1740.
Step 7) Finally, since one dozen cups costs $1740, then the total cost of buying each cup would be $1740 divided by 12, which is approximately $145 per cup. However, if you want an exact value without rounding, it's $1740/12 = $145 per cup. 
The answer is $1740."

Step 1) Calculate the total cost of the jacket and shoes:
The answer is $30 (jacket) + $20 (each pair of shoes) x 2 = $70 (total cost of jackets and shoes). Therefore, Sara needs $70 in total to buy both items. Step 2) Calculate how much money Sara earns per babysitting job and per lawn mowing job: From step 1, we know that Sara earned $5 per babysitting job and $4 per lawn mowing job. Therefore, she earns $5 + $4 = $9 per babysitting job or lawn mowing job. Step 3) Calculate how many times Sara needs to work to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes: We need to calculate how many jobs it takes for Sara to save up enough money for the total cost ($70) plus the amount she already had ($10), which equals $80. To find out how many times she needs to work, divide the total needed by the earnings per job: $80 / $9 = approximately 8.89 jobs. Since Sara cannot work a fraction of a job, she would need to work 9 times to earn enough money to afford the jacket and shoes. Answer: Sara needs to mow the lawn 9 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes."

Step 1) Let's assume the number of red chickens is x.
Step 2) According to the information given, the number of white chickens is x + 2 (two more than the number of red chickens).
Step 3) Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so all red chickens together would produce 3x eggs per day.
Step 4) White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so all white chickens together would produce 5(x+2) eggs per day.
Step 5) The total amount of eggs collected by Jerry every day is the sum of the eggs produced by both types of chickens, which equals 42 eggs per day. So we set up an equation: 3x + 5(x+2) = 42.
Step 6) Simplify the equation: 3x + 5x + 10 = 42
Step 7) Combine like terms: 8x + 10 = 42
Step 8) Subtract 10 from both sides: 8x = 32
Step 9) Divide both sides by 8: x = 4
Step 10) Therefore, Jerry has 4 red chickens.
The answer is 4."

"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's determine Harriet's current age:
The answer is 21 years old (as given in the question). Now we know Harriet is 21 years old now, which will change in three years as stated in the problem. Therefore, Harriet's age in three years would be 21 + 3 = 24 years old. This makes sense because we're adding 3 years to her current age, so it wouldn't affect her actual age in any other way since she won't get older or younger during those three years. Let's move on to the next step by calculating the ages of Adrian and Zack based on Harriet's information provided in the problem statement. Step 2) Next, let's calculate Adrian's age based on the relationship between Adrian's age and Harriet's age given in the problem statement. The problem states that Adrian's age is three times Harriet's age. Since Harriet is currently 21 years old, Adrian's age would be 3 * 21 = 63 years old. Now we have all the ages needed to find the average age of the three people in three years. Step 3) Finally, let's calculate the average age of the three people in three years using their respective ages. To do this, we'll add up their ages and divide by the number of people. Average age = (Harriet's age in three years + Adrian's age + Zack's age) / Number of people = (24 + 63 + Zack's age) / 3 We need to calculate Zack's age first. Step 4) According to the problem statement, Harriet is half the age of Zack. Therefore, if Harriet is 21 years old, then Zack must be twice her age, i.e., Zack's age = 2 * 21 = 42 years old. Now that we know both Harriet's and Zack's ages, we can calculate the average age. Average age = (24 + 63 + 42) / 3 = 129 / 3 = 43 years old. So, the average age of the three people in three years will be 43 years old."

Step 1) First we need to find out how many points Yuri scored. We know that Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, half of that would be 68/2=34. Adding 10 more gives us 34+10=44 points for Yuri.
Step 2) Next, let's calculate how many points Brianna scored. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, adding 17 gives us 68+17=85 points for Brianna.
Step 3) To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract all the known scores from the total score. The total score was 251 points, and we already accounted for 68 (Naomi), 44 (Yuri), and 85 (Brianna). Subtracting these from the total gives us 251-(68+44+85)=154 points.

Since this question doesn't mention any calls with his boss, we'll focus on the extra minutes used by him for other purposes which is 300 minutes/month. So, the total minutes used for all calls this month is 450 + 300 = 750 minutes/month."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First, let's find out how many fries Kyle took. Kyle took 5 fries.
Step 2) Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which means Billy took 2 * 5 = 10 fries.
Step 3) The total number of fries taken by Kyle and Billy combined is 5 (Kyle) + 10 (Billy) = 15 fries.
Step 4) Now we know Griffin started with 24 fries, Kyle took 5, and Billy took 10. In total, these three people took 15 fries away from Griffin.
Step 5) To determine how many fries Griffin had before this happened, we add up what was taken away: 15 fries.
Step 6) Now, we know Griffin ended up with 27 fries, so we need to subtract the 15 fries that were taken away from the 27 fries to find out how many he had initially: 27 - 15 = 12 fries.
Step 7) Since we already knew Griffin started with 24 fries, we can subtract the 12 fries he had initially from the total to find out how many Ginger gave him: 24 - 12 = 12 fries.
The answer is 12 fries."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) We know that there are 4 snails in one aquarium and 32 snails in another aquarium. 
Step 2) To find out the difference between these two numbers, we subtract the smaller number (4) from the larger number (32): 32 - 4 = 28.
Step 3) According to the problem statement, this difference (28) is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. Therefore, we divide the difference by 2 to find out the number of fish per aquarium: 28 / 2 = 14.
Step 4) Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, we can conclude that there are 14 fish in each aquarium.  
The answer is 14 fish in each aquarium."
"Step-by-step answer:
Step 1) First calculate the total number of hours the makeup artist works per week:
The ANswer is 6 x 4 = 24 hours per week (for 4 movies). This makes 24 x 5 = 120 hours in total for the whole movie (since there are 5 weeks in total). The ANswer is 120 hours total. Step 2) Calculate the base fee before any discounts or additional costs: 120 hours x $250/hour = $30,000. The ANswer is $30,000. Step 3) Calculate the discount on top of the base fee: $30,000 x.10 = $3,000. The ANswer is $3,000. Step 4) Subtract the discount from the base fee to get the final payment: $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000. The ANswer is $27,000."

Step 1) Let's find out how many cookies Sue's sister ate each day.
Step 2) Monday: Sister ate 5 cookies, Sue ate 4 times as many (4*5=20). Total for Sue = 20+5=25 cookies.
Step 3) Tuesday: Sister ate 13 cookies, Sue ate twice as many (2*13=26). Total for Sue = 26+13=39 cookies.
Step 4) Sue's total cookies over both days: 25+39=64 cookies.
Step 5) Sister's total cookies over both days: 5+13=18 cookies.
Step 6) Difference in calorie intake between Sue and her sister: 64-18=46 calories.
The answer is 46 calories."
