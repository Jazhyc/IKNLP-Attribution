1) First, calculate the number of eggs laid by Janet's ducks per day: 16 eggs/day.
2) Determine the number of eggs Janet eats for breakfast: 3 eggs/day.
3) Calculate the remaining eggs after breakfast consumption: 16 eggs/day - 3 eggs/day = 13 eggs/day.
4) Subtract the number of eggs used to bake muffins for her friends: 13 eggs/day - 4 eggs/day = 9 eggs/day.
5) Calculate the amount Janet earns from selling the remaining eggs at the farmers' market: 9 eggs/day × $2/egg = $18/day.
The answer is $18."

1) First, let's find out how much feed all the chickens eat together every day. 
2) Since each chicken eats 3 cups per day, then 20 chickens would eat a total of 20 x 3 = 60 cups of feed per day.
3) We know that in the morning, 15 cups were given and in the afternoon, 25 cups were given. 
4) Therefore, the remaining amount of feed needed for the evening meal would be 60 (total daily consumption) - 15 (morning) - 25 (afternoon) = 20 cups.
5) This leaves us with 20 cups of feed for the evening meal.
The answer is 20 cups."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's determine the number of glasses that cost 60% of the original price. Since every second glass costs less than the others, we divide the total number of glasses by 2:
16) / 2 = 8 glasses cost 60% of the price.
2) Next, we calculate the cost of these 8 glasses (which are half-price):
8) x $5/glass = $40.
3) The remaining 8 glasses cost full price ($5), so we multiply this amount by 8:
8) x $5/glass = $40.
4) Finally, we add up the costs of both sets of glasses:
40) + 40) = $80.
The answer is $80."

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First we need to calculate how far into the download Carla was when the system restarted. Since the computer runs at 2GB per minute normally, if you divide the total size (200GB) by the speed (2GB/min), you get the time it would take to finish the entire download without any interruptions or restarts. 
2) 200GB / 2GB/min = 100 minutes
3) This means that the first half of the download took 100 minutes because it's split evenly between the normal download rate and the restart period. 
4) During this time, Carla could have downloaded about 50GB of the file because she'd be halfway done. But then the system restarts, taking an additional 20 minutes.
5) The second part of the download starts again from scratch, meaning Carla needs to download all 200GB of the file again. 
6) So, the total time required to complete the download is the sum of the time taken during the initial download phase plus the time taken during the restart and re-download phases. 
7) Total time = Time for first half of download + Restart time + Time for second half of download"

"Step-by-step answer:
1) In the first month, there were 60 downloads.
2) In the second month, the number of downloads increased three times compared to the first month's amount: 60 * 3 = 180 downloads.
3) However, in the third month, these 180 downloads decreased by 30%, which means only 70% (or.7) of them remained: 180 *.7 = 126 downloads.
4) To find the total number of downloads over the three months, we add all three numbers together: 60 (first month) + 180 (second month) + 126 (third month) = 366 downloads in total.  
The answer is 366."

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First calculate Carlos' initial investment by multiplying the number of trees (which is 1) by the cost per tree ($90).
2) Next, subtract the initial investment from this amount to find out how much Carlos needs to earn back.
3) Carlos earns $1.50 per lemon, so divide this amount by the yearly expense to find how many lemons he needs to sell to cover the annual expenses.
4) Finally, divide the remaining amount Carlos needs to earn by the earnings per lemon to determine how many years it takes to break even. 
5) This calculation gives us: $90 (initial investment) - (1 * $90) = $0.
6) To cover the annual expenses, Carlos needs to sell enough lemons to make up for $3/year x 1 = $3.
7) At $1.50/lemon, Carlos needs to sell $3 / $1.50 = 2 lemons per year to cover expenses.
8) To cover both initial investment and annual expenses, Carlos needs to sell enough lemons to make up for $90 (investment) + $3 (annual expenses) = $93.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's calculate the distance traveled on the first day when the trains were moving westward.
2) Distance = Speed × Time
3) Since both trains traveled at the same speed (assuming constant speed), we can set up an equation using this formula. Let's call the speed ""S"".
4) We know that S × 80 = 80S because the distance traveled was 80 miles.
5) Therefore, the speed of each train is 80 miles per day.
6) Next, let's calculate the distance traveled on the second day when the trains were moving northward.
7) Again, we use the same formula: Distance = Speed × Time
8) We know that S × 150 = 150S because the distance traveled was 150 miles.
9) Therefore, the speed of each train is also 150 miles per day.
10) In summary, both trains traveled a total of 80 + 150 = 230 miles over the two days. However, since they traveled different distances each day, the distance covered by each train will depend on which direction it was going during those days. If we"

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to calculate the amount of water in the initial orange drink mix. Since the orange drink is made up of 2/3 water, then (2/3)*10 = 20/3 or approximately 6.67 liters of water.
2) Next, we'll figure out the amount of water in the pineapple drink mix. The pineapple drink is composed of 3/5 water, so (3/5)*15 = 4.5 liters of water.
3) We know that a total of 24 liters of mixed drinks will result when we combine the orange and pineapple drinks. Therefore, we subtract the spilled liter of orange drink which was 1 liter, leaving us with 24 - 1 = 23 liters of mixed drinks.
4) To find the total amount of water in these 23 liters, we sum the amounts of water from both mixes: 6.67 liters (from the orange mix) + 4.5 liters (from the pineapple mix) = 11.17 liters of water.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's find out when Samantha was born. Since she is currently 31 years old, she must have been born 31 years ago.
2) Raymon was born 6 years before Samantha, so he was born 31 - 6 = 25 years ago.
3) Raymon had a son who was 23 years old, which means the son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago (which doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of years).
4) The problem states that Raymon had a son at the age of 23, meaning the son was actually born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago. This indicates an error in the initial information provided.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Let's denote the original price of the book as \( P \).
2) The book was sold at a 25% discount, which means Kyle paid 75% (or 0.75 times) of the original price.
3) We know that 75% of \( P \) equals $19.50. Therefore, we can write this relationship as:
4) \( 0.75P = \$19.50 \)
5) To find \( P \), we need to divide both sides by 0.75:
6) \( P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \)

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.
2) We know that G = S + 30 (since there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins).
3) The total number of coins is 110, so we also know that S + G = 110.
4) Substituting the first equation into the second one gives us: S + (S + 30) = 110.
5) Simplifying this equation, we get 2S + 30 = 110.
6) Subtracting 30 from both sides gives us 2S = 80.
7) Dividing by 2, we find out that S = 40.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) John runs 60 miles a week over 3 days, which means he runs an average of 60/3 = 20 miles per day.
2) The first day he runs for 3 hours.
3) The second and third days, he runs half as much as the first day, so he runs 3 / 2 = 1.5 hours on those days.
4) To find out how fast John runs, we need to divide the distance by the time spent running. 
5) For the first day, it's 3 hours divided by 20 miles equals 0.15 hours per mile.
6) For the second day, it's 1.5 hours divided by 20 miles equals 0.075 hours per mile.
7) For the third day, it's also 1.5 hours divided by 20 miles equals 0.075 hours per mile.
8) Therefore, John runs at a speed of 0.15 mph on the first day, 0.075 mph on the second and third days. Since all three days have the same pace, John runs at a consistent speed of 0."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) Dana's skipping speed is given as 3 miles per hour. Since skipping is half as fast as running, we can determine her running speed by doubling this value.
32) Therefore, Dana's running speed is 3 x 2 = 6 miles per hour.
33) Dana can run at a rate of 4 times faster than she can walk. Thus, her walking speed is 6 / 4 = 1.5 miles per hour.
34) In six hours, Dana will spend 1/3 of the time (six hours) on running, which is 6 x 1/3 = 2 hours.
35) The remaining two-thirds of the time (six hours - 2 hours = 4 hours) will be spent walking.
36) During these 4 hours, Dana walks at a speed of 1.5 miles per hour, covering 4 x 1.5 = 6 miles during walking.
37) Adding the distance covered while running (6 miles) to the distance covered while walking (6 miles), we get the total distance traveled in six hours: 6 + 6 = 12 miles.
The answer is 12 miles."

2) Next, we know that after the guests took some pieces, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken, we subtract the remaining pieces from the initial total: 40 pieces (initially) - 14 pieces (remaining) = 26 pieces taken by the guests.
The answer is 26 pieces were taken by the guests."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to find out how many calories are in one serving of chips. We know that a 300g bag contains 5 servings, and each serving has 250 calories. Therefore, the number of calories in one serving is 250/5= 50 calories.
2) Next, we need to calculate the total amount of calories in the entire bag of chips. Since there are 5 servings in the bag, it would contain 5*50= 250 calories.
3) The question states that your daily calorie target is 2000 calories. You've already consumed 1800 calories, which leaves you with 2000-1800= 200 calories remaining.
4) To determine how many grams of chips you can consume with these remaining calories, divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram. Assuming each chip weighs about 1 gram (since this isn't explicitly stated), then 200/50= 4 grams of chips will help you meet your daily calorie goal while staying within your budget.
The answer is 4 grams of chips."

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Tuesday. Since it was 2/5 times more than Monday, we multiply Monday's amount by 2/5:
2) Articles written on Tuesday = Monday's articles * (2/5)
3) Articles written on Tuesday = 5 * (2/5) = 2 articles
4) Next, let's calculate the number of articles Meredith wrote on Wednesday. It was twice the number she wrote on Tuesday:
4) Articles written on Wednesday = Tuesday's articles * 2
5) Articles written on Wednesday = 2 * 2 = 4 articles
6) Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote over these three days:
7) Total articles = Monday's articles + Tuesday's articles + Wednesday's articles
8) Total articles = 5 + 2 + 4 = 11 articles
9) Finally, let's calculate the total time she spent writing these articles. Since each article takes 4 hours to write:

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse.
2) She used 220 post-it notes on the coffee cups.
3) She had 23 post-it notes remaining after all these activities.
4) To find out how many post-it notes she had when she went into the store, we need to add the initial number of post-it notes (80), the number she used on the coffee cups (220), and the remaining post-it notes (23). 
5) This gives us: 80 + 220 + 23 = 323 post-it notes.
6) Since this was also the total amount of post-it notes she had when she came back from the store, it must be equal to the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased plus the ones she already had.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to calculate the total cost before any interest is applied. Since there are 5 cell phones and each costs $150, the total cost is \(5 \times \$150 = \$750\).
2) Next, we calculate the total interest. The interest rate is 2%, which is 0.02 when expressed as a decimal. Therefore, the total interest on the purchase is \(0.02 \times \$750 = \$15\).
3) Adding the total interest to the original cost gives us the total amount paid by Shiela, which is \(\$750 + \$15 = \$765\).

1) First, we need to round the prices to the nearest dollar.
2) Marigold price (rounded): $3
3) Petunia price (rounded): $2
4) Begonia price (rounded): $2
5) Now let's calculate the earnings by multiplying the number of pots sold by their respective rounded prices.
6) Earnings from marigolds: 12 pots x $3/pot = $36
7) Earnings from petunias: 9 pots x $2/pot = $18
8) Earnings from begonias: 17 pots x $2/pot = $34
9) Finally, add up the earnings from all types of flowers: $36 + $18 + $34 = $88
The answer is $88."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to determine the square footage of each level by working backwards from the top level. Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can calculate the square footage of each level starting from the bottom.
2) The top level (level 4) has 16 square feet.
3) Level 3 would then have 16 x 2 = 32 square feet.
4) Level 2 would have 32 x 2 = 64 square feet.
5) Finally, Level 1 would have 64 x 2 = 128 square feet.
6) To find the average square footage per level, we add up all the levels and divide by the number of levels (which is 4).
7) Total square footage = 16 + 32 + 64 + 128 = 240 square feet
8) Average square footage = 240 / 4 = 60 square feet per level.
The answer is 60 square feet per level."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) The puppy needs 1 cup of food per day for the first 180 days, which equals 1 x 180 = 180 cups of dog food.
2) After these 180 days, the puppy needs 2 cups of food per day, which amounts to 2 x (365 - 180) = 2 x 185 = 370 cups of dog food for the remaining part of its life.
3) In total, the puppy will need 180 + 370 = 550 cups of dog food for the whole year.
4) One bag of dog food contains 110 cups, therefore Cecilia will need 550 / 110 = 5 bags of dog food for the first year.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to find out how much laundry David does. Since Sarah does four times as much laundry as David, and Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, then David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.
2) Next, we know that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Therefore, Raymond does \( \frac{400}{2} = 200 \) pounds of laundry.
3) To find the difference between what Raymond and David do, subtract David's amount from Raymond's amount: \( 200 - 100 = 100 \) pounds.
The answer is 100 pounds."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's calculate the number of packages Vincent would need if he chooses the cheaper option (package of 2 flowers).
2) To find this out, we divide the total number of flowers he wants to buy (18) by the number of flowers per package (2). 
3) This gives us 18/2 = 9 packages.
4) Next, let's calculate the total cost if he buys these 9 packages.
5) Since each package costs $1, the total cost would be 9*1 = $9.
6) Now, let's calculate the cost if he buys the other option (package of 3 flowers).
7) To find the number of packages needed for 18 flowers, we divide the total number of flowers he wants to buy (18) by the number of flowers per package (3).
8) This gives us 18/3 = 6 packages.
9) The total cost for these 6 packages would be 6*2.50 = $15.
10) Finally, let's subtract the total cost of the cheaper option from the total cost of the more expensive one to find out how much money he saves.

1) Let's assume the number of games they lost as 'x'.
2) Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games they won would be x + 8.
3) The total number of games played is 22, which includes both wins and losses. Therefore, we can write an equation based on this information:
22) = (number of wins) + (number of losses)
4) Substituting the values into the equation, we get:

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Gene starts at age 23 and continues until he is 34, which means he's lived through 34 - 23 = 11 years.
2) Since he goes on four vacations per year, this translates into 11 x 4 = 44 vacations.
3) Therefore, Gene has 44 quilt blocks in total as he sews them together using the blocks from each of his 44 vacations. The answer is 44. This represents all possible combinations of the blocks representing his various trips. Each combination would be a unique quilt block. If we wanted to calculate the number of distinct ways he could arrange these blocks, it would be factorial (44!), or approximately 1.09 x 10^30, indicating an astronomical number of possibilities! But for practical purposes, just knowing he has 44 quilt blocks is sufficient. Each block will represent a specific trip, whether it's a beach vacation, mountain climbing, etc., making up a rich collection of memories. The variety of experiences he has recorded adds immense value to his quilting project.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) The sauce loses half its volume when cooked, which means it retains 1/2 or 50% of its original volume.
2) Since 16 ounces of sauce equals 32 ounces of sauce (because 32 ÷ 16 = 2), then 16 ounces represents 2 parts out of the original sauce's 4 parts (since 32 ÷ 2 = 16).
3) Therefore, the full amount of sauce before cooking would be 16 × 4 = 64 ounces.
4) When cooked, the sauce retains 50% of its original volume, meaning Freda used 64 × 50% = 32 ounces worth of tomatoes.
5) Since each can of tomatoes contains 3 tomatoes, Freda used 32 ÷ 3 = 10.67, or approximately 11 tomatoes (rounding up since you can't use a fraction of a tomato in this context).

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's calculate the dimensions of one box without considering the wall thickness.
2) One box measures 5 inches x 6 inches x 4 inches.
3) Since the walls are 1 inch thick on all sides, we need to subtract twice the wall thickness (one side per dimension) from each dimension.
4) Dimensions for the interior space would then be:
5) Interior length: 5 inches - 2 inches = 3 inches
6) Interior width: 6 inches - 2 inches = 4 inches
7) Interior height: 4 inches - 2 inches = 2 inches

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we know Frankie watched 1 hour (or 60 minutes) of TV on Monday and Tuesday combined. This totals to 60 minutes.
2) On Wednesday, he watched 30 minutes of a 30-minute show.
3) On Thursday, he watched 1 hour (60 minutes) plus another 30 minutes, totaling 90 minutes.
4) On Friday, he watched 2 hours (or 120 minutes), which includes 2 additional 1-hour shows.
5) Adding these times together gives us 60 + 30 + 90 + 120 = 300 minutes.
6) We know this equals 7 hours or 420 minutes (since 1 hour = 60 minutes).
7) To find out how many 30-minute shows he watched on Wednesday, we subtract the time spent watching other shows from the total time he spent watching TV: 420 - 300 = 120 minutes.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year by \( x \).
2) According to the problem statement, he made twice as many this time around, which would be \( 2x \).
3) However, he ended up with 15 more than he planned, so he actually had \( 2x + 15 \) cookies.
4) Out of these, he dropped 5, leaving him with \( 2x + 15 - 5 = 2x + 10 \) cookies.
5) The final count given in the problem is 110 cookies, so we set up the equation:
6) \( 2x + 10 = 110 \)
7) Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:
8) \( 2x = 100 \)
9) Dividing both sides by 2 gives us:
10) \( x = 50 \)
11) Therefore, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year.

1) First we need to calculate the area of Beatrice's fruit roll-up sheet. Since it's two roll-ups wide and 24 rolls long, its area is 2*24=48 square units.
2) Next, let's calculate the area of Marcell's fruit roll-up sheet. It's three roll-ups wide and 14 rolls long, so its area is 3*14=42 square units.
3) The total area of all the fruit roll-up sheets is 48+42=90 square units.
4) They ate their whole amounts, which is equivalent to eating all the areas (90 square units).
5) To find the average number of rolls eaten per unit area, divide the total area by the total number of rolls: 90/90 = 1 roll per unit area.
The answer is 1 roll per unit area."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to find out how fast Julia rows back towards the shore. We know that it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, her speed (in feet per second) is 20/16 = 1.25 feet per second.
2) Next, we need to determine how far Julia rows in 64 seconds. To do this, we multiply her speed by the number of seconds she rows: 1.25 feet/second x 64 seconds = 80 feet.
3) Since the boat is leaking two liters of water for every ten feet, we need to calculate how many liters of water leaked during Julia's journey. We divide the distance she traveled by 10 and then multiply by 2: (80 / 10) x 2 = 16 liters.
The answer is 16 liters."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to determine how many times the whiteboard is used in one day by all four teachers. Since each teacher takes 2 lessons per day and uses the whiteboard in each lesson, the number of lessons in a day is \(4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher/day} = 8 \text{ lessons/day}\).
2) Next, since each use of the whiteboard counts as one cleaning session (as stated in the problem), the number of cleanings per day is equal to the number of lessons, which is 8 cleanings per day. Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 8 times in a day. The answer is 8 cleanings.<tool_call>

"Step-by-step answer:
1) We know that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, which means it costs (watermelon price - 5).
2) We also know that a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, which means it costs (pepper price * 3).
3) Let's denote the price of a pepper as P. Therefore, the price of a watermelon would be 3P.
4) The price of an orange would then be (3P - 5).
5) Given that each pepper costs $15, we can find the price of a watermelon by substituting P with $15 in the equation for the price of a watermelon: 
35) Price of watermelon = 3 * ($15)

3) Solving this equation for \( x \), we divide both sides by 3: \( x = 12 / 3 \). Therefore, \( x = 4 \).
4) Now that we know Dorothy has 4 Facebook friends, we can find out how many friends James has. The problem states that James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply \( x \) (Dorothy's friend count) by 4: \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \).
5) Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends on Facebook. Thus, our final answer is 16. 
The answer is 16."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to convert all distances into the same unit, which is feet. 
2) Since 1 mile equals 5280 feet, Steve's distance is 3 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 15,840 feet.
3) Tim's distance is already given as 2 miles x 5280 feet/mile = 10,560 feet.
4) We know that Steve bikes at a speed of 440 feet/minute, while Tim skates at a speed of 264 feet/minute.
5) To find out who takes longer to reach home, we divide the distance by their respective speeds.
6) For Steve: 15,840 feet / 440 feet/minute = 36 minutes
7) For Tim: 10,560 feet / 264 feet/minute = 40 minutes
8) The winner (Steve) will be waiting 40 minutes - 36 minutes = 4 minutes before the loser (Tim) finishes the race. Therefore, Steve will be waiting 4 minutes before Tim arrives back home.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Let's denote the number of French fries in the original pack as X.
2) Dave ate 14 French fries, so there were X - 14 French fries left.
3) The seagull ate half the amount of what Dave ate, which was (X/2) French fries. 
4) Three pigeons then ate 3 French fries each, so they ate a total of 3*3 = 9 French fries.
5) A raccoon stole two-thirds of the remaining French fries. Before this theft, there were (X-14)-9= X-23 French fries left. Two-thirds of these would be stolen by the raccoon, or (2/3)(X-23).
6) After all these events, one French fry remained, meaning the raccoon took 2/3(X-23) - 1 French fries.
7) We know that the raccoon stole exactly 2/3 of the remaining fries, so we can set up an equation:
23) 2/3(X-23) - 1 = 2/3(X-23)
8) Solving this equation gives us X = 46.

1) First, we need to calculate the distance each person ran.
2) Blake runs back and forth 15 times, which means he runs 100 x 2 = 200 yards.
3) Kelly runs back and forth once, which is another 100 yards.
4) Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs when she starts running to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. This means she runs 40 x 2 x 34 = 2720 yards.
5) To find out who ran further, we add up both distances: 200 + 100 = 300 yards (for Blake).
6) 2720 + 100 = 2820 yards (for Kelly)

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's find out what Jerry needs to roll to get a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. So, the probability of rolling one of these three numbers is 3/6 or 1/2.
2) Next, let's consider rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. Since we need two consecutive outcomes, the possible combinations are 2-2, 2-4, 2-6, 4-4, 4-6, and 6-6. This gives us 6 favorable outcomes out of 6*6=36 possible outcomes when considering both sides of the dice. Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is 6/36 or 1/6.

2) This tells us that 26 full groups of rats received 6 pieces each, leaving 4 pieces remaining.
3) Since these remaining 4 pieces could not form another complete group (as each rat needs 6 pieces), it means that one additional rat was counted towards this distribution.
4) Therefore, there are 27 rats in total.
5) We know there are 10 cages of hamsters and each receives 5 pieces of straw. To find out how many cages there are, we divide the total number of hamster straws by the number of straws per cage:
10) / 5 = 2
6) So there are 2 cages of hamsters.
7) Subtracting the number of hamster cages from the total rodent cages gives us the number of rat cages:
10) - 2 = 8

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, calculate the amount of interest on $100 over three months.
2) The formula for calculating simple interest is: Interest = Principal x Rate x Time
3) In this case, Principal (P) is $100, Rate (R) is 2% per month or 0.02 when expressed as a decimal, and Time (T) is 3 months.
4) Substitute these values into the formula: Interest = $100 x 0.02 x 3
5) Calculate the result: Interest = $6
6) Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $100 (original debt) plus $6 (interest), which equals $106. Answer: Mandy should give Benedict $106. 
7) Note: This calculation assumes no additional factors such as late fees, penalties or any other charges applied by Benedict. In real life situations, debts often involve various complexities not considered here. However, based solely on the given information, we can determine the exact amount Mandy needs to pay. If you want an estimate including potential late fees or penalties, please provide those details. Otherwise, this answer will suffice for the given problem statement."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) Let's denote the number of bags sold as x.
2) The cost for transporting x bags to the warehouse would be $2x (since it costs $2 to transport each bag).
3) The revenue from selling x bags at $30 each would be 30x.
4) The total cost for buying the bags was $20x (cost per bag times number of bags), plus the transportation cost which is $2x, making it $20x + $2x or $22x.
5) The total profit is given by the difference between the revenue and the total cost, which is 30x - ($20x + $2x). We know this equals $400, so we set up an equation:

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Tom starts with 50 trees.
2) In one year, he plants 10 new trees and chops down 2 old ones, which results in 10 - 2 = 8 net new trees added.
3) Over 10 years, this pattern repeats 10 times, resulting in an additional 8 x 10 = 80 trees added over 10 years.
4) Therefore, after 10 years, Tom would have 50 (initial) + 80 (added) = 130 trees.
5) However, after 10 years, 30% of these trees die due to natural causes.
6) This means 30/100 * 130 = 39 trees die.
7) Therefore, after accounting for tree deaths, Tom would have 130 - 39 = 91 trees remaining.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Initially, there were 18 pink flamingos.
2) On Saturday, they removed one-third of the flamingos, which is 1/3 * 18 = 6 pink flamingos.
3) The remaining number of pink flamingos was 18 - 6 = 12 pink flamingos.
4) They then added 18 more pink flamingos, making it 12 + 18 = 30 pink flamingos.
5) In total, there were 30 pink flamingos and 6 white flamingos (since they painted one-third of the original ones).
6) To find the difference between pink and white flamingos, subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos: 30 - 6 = 24.
The answer is 24 pink flamingos more than white flamingos."

1) Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool by \( S \).
2) The big pool was twice as full as the small pool 4 minutes ago, which means it had \( 2S \) gallons of water then.
3) Since both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we know that every minute, the big pool loses \( 4 \times 2 = 8 \) gallons (since its capacity remains constant), while the small pool loses \( 4 \) gallons per minute.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) The distance from New Jersey to Rochester is divided into two parts: one part traveled by bus and another part traveled by car.
2) Since it takes Andrew 6 days to travel by bus, this means the first half of the journey (traveling by bus) would take 6 days.
3) Therefore, the second half of the journey (traveling by car), which is also 6 days long since it's half the distance of the bus journey.
4) To find out how many days Andrew spends traveling to Rochester by bus, we add the time spent on the bus journey to the time spent returning by car: 6 days + 6 days = 12 days.
5) Since Andrew travels both ways (to Rochester by bus and back by car), the total number of days he'll spend traveling is 12 days to Rochester + 12 days returning = 24 days. 
The answer is 24."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's find out how many water type cards James has after losing 8 of them.
2) Initially, James had 40 water type cards. After losing 8, he'll have 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards.
3) Next, we need to add the new grass type cards. James initially had 20 grass type cards and then bought 14 more. This makes him have 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.
4) To find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we need to divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100.
5) The total number of cards is the sum of all types: 30 fire + 20 grass + 32 water + 14 grass = 96 cards.
6) So, the percentage chance is (32 / 96) * 100 ≈ 33.33%
7) Rounded to the nearest integer, this is 33% chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type. Therefore, the final answer is "

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, we need to find out how many watermelons Ashlyn took home initially.
2) We know that 30% of the 120 watermelons were ready for harvest, so 30% of 120 equals (30/100) x 120 = 36 watermelons.
3) Therefore, there were 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons that were not yet ready for harvest when Ashlyn returned two weeks later.
4) Two weeks later, half of these remaining watermelons were ripe enough for harvest, which means half of 84 would be harvested.
5) Half of 84 equals (1/2) x 84 = 42 watermelons were taken home by Ashlyn during this period.
6) Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after two weeks is 84 - 42 = 42 watermelons. Therefore, there were 42 watermelons that were not yet ready for harvest after the two-week period. The answer is 42.

1) Ram starts with 25 pens.
2) To make one full pen using ink from five empty ones, he needs 6 pens (1 full pen + 5 empty pens).
3) Ram can use this process until he doesn't have enough ink to make another pen.
4) The number of times he can repeat this process depends on how many full pens he can create with the remaining pens after making as many full pens as possible with each set of six.
5) Let's calculate it step by step.
6) First time: 25 / 6 = 4 remainder 1. So, he gets 4 full pens and 1 leftover pen.
7) Second time: With 1 leftover pen, he will need 1 more pen from the first batch (to complete the fifth full pen), which leaves him with 1 full pen and 1 pen of ink left.
8) Third time: With 1 pen of ink left, he will need 1 more pen from the second batch, leaving him with no additional pens or ink.
9) Total pens obtained: 4 + 1 + 1 = 6 pens.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) First, let's count how many books Dolly has. Dolly has 2 books.
2) Next, let's count how many books Pandora has. Pandora has 1 book.
3) When Dolly reads Pandora's book, it counts towards Dolly's reading total because Dolly owns this book.
4) Similarly, when Pandora reads Dolly's book, it counts towards Pandora's reading total because Pandora owns this book.
5) Therefore, we need to add up all the books together: Dolly's 2 books + Pandora's 1 book = 3 books.
6) Additionally, since they both read each other's books, these also count toward their totals: Dolly's 2 books (already counted above) + Pandora's 1 book (already counted above).
7) So, by adding these together, we get: 2 (from Dolly) + 1 (from Pandora) = 3 additional books.
8) Adding those 3 additional books to our initial total gives us a grand total of 3 + 3 = 6 books read collectively by the end of their readings. 
The answer is 6 books."
"Step-by-step answer:
1) Mike initially had 5 pen pals.
2) He then stopped being pen pals with 2 of those, leaving him with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
3) Each pen pal sends 2 letters per week, making it 3 * 2 = 6 letters sent per week by all pen pals combined.
4) Since he writes a page for each letter, this totals to 6 pages written per week.
5) Writing one page takes 6 minutes, so writing 6 pages would take 6 * 6 = 36 minutes.
6) Converting minutes to hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), this becomes 36 / 60 =.6 hours spent writing per week.

"Step-by-step answer:
1) Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.
2) Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with 24 - 5 = 19 fries.
3) Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is 2 * 5 = 10 fries. This leaves Griffin with 19 - 10 = 9 fries.
4) Ginger gave Griffin some fries, increasing the count to 9 + x, where x is the number of fries Ginger gave.
5) Colby took 3 fewer fries than Kyle, which is 5 - 3 = 2 fries. This reduces the remaining fries by 2, making it 9 - 2 = 7 fries.
6) At this point, Griffin ends up with 27 fries. Therefore, we can set up an equation based on the information given: 9 + x = 27.

2) On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
3) On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13 * 5 = 65 cookies.
4) The total number of cookies Sue's sister ate is 5 + 65 = 70 cookies.
5) Since Sue ate four times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, she ate 4 * 5 = 20 cookies.
6) And since Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, she ate 2 * 65 = 130 cookies.
7) The total number of cookies Sue ate is 20 + 130 = 150 cookies.
8) To calculate the difference in calories between Sue and her sister, we need to multiply their respective totals by the calorie count per cookie (200 calories).
