- First, calculate the number of eggs laid by the ducks per day: 16 eggs/day.
- Janet eats 3 eggs for breakfast every morning, so subtract those: 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining.
- She also bakes muffins for her friends using 4 eggs, so again subtract those: 13 - 4 = 9 eggs remaining.
- Janet sells these remaining eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so multiply the number of eggs by this price: 9 * $2 = $18 per day.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The original price of the house was $80,000.
- Josh put in $50,000 worth of repairs.
- The increase in value due to the repairs was 150% of the original price, which would be $80,000 * 1.5 = $120,000.
- Therefore, the total value of the house after the repairs is $80,000 (original) + $50,000 (repairs) + $120,000 (increase) = $250,000.
- To find out how much profit Josh made, we subtract the initial purchase amount ($80,000) from the final value of the house ($250,000), which equals $170,000.
The answer is 170000.<"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- James runs 3 sprints every time he goes running.
- Each time, he runs 60 meters per sprint.
- Therefore, he runs 3 x 60 = 180 meters each time he goes running.
- Since he runs 3 times a week, he runs a total of 3 x 180 = 540 meters a week. Thus, James runs 540 meters a week. The answer is 540.  This calculation takes into account all given data points: the number of sprints (3), the distance per sprint (60 meters), and the frequency of running (3 times a week). By multiplying these values together, we obtain the total distance covered by James during one week's running session. The units of measurement remain consistent throughout this process: meters. It's important to note that the unit of ""sprint"" might not be directly relevant to the final result since it was used as a variable rather than an actual distance or volume. However, for the sake of clarity, we keep it in the problem statement. The key takeaway here is understanding how to perform multiplication operations when dealing with multiple instances of the same quantity. This type of problem"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The total amount of feed given per chicken every day is 3 cups.
- There are 20 chickens, so the total daily feed requirement for all chickens combined is 20 x 3 = 60 cups.
- In the morning, 15 cups of feed are given, and in the afternoon, 25 cups of feed are given.
- Therefore, the total amount of feed given over the course of these two meals is 15 + 25 = 40 cups.
- To find out how many cups of feed are needed for the final meal, we subtract the total amount of feed given in the first two meals from the total daily feed requirement.
- This calculation would be 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed needed for the final meal.
The answer is 20.<"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The first glass costs $5.
- Every second glass costs 60% of the original price, which is \(5 \times 0.6 = $3\).
- Since there are 16 glasses, we can divide this into groups of two (every second glass) because the pricing pattern repeats every two glasses.
- For 8 pairs of glasses (since 16 divided by 2 equals 8), Kylar will pay \(8 \times ($5 + $3) = 8 \times $8 = $64\).
- Therefore, Kylar needs to pay $64 for all 16 glasses.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, calculate the time it takes to download half of the file without any interruptions or delays. Since Carla's normal download speed is 2 GB per minute, then half of the file would take 200 / 2 = 100 minutes to download normally.
- Next, determine the amount of data downloaded during this first phase. This would be 100 minutes times 2 GB per minute equals 200 GB.
- However, due to the delay caused by the system restart, Carla will lose 200 GB worth of data halfway through the process. This leaves her with 200 GB - 200 GB = 0 GB to download.
- The next step is to account for the fact that Carla must start over when restarting the download. Thus, the full file size (200 GB) needs to be downloaded again.
- Therefore, the total time to complete the download includes the initial 100 minutes plus another 100 minutes because she has to start all over again. This adds up to 100 + 100 = 200 minutes.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, calculate the distance John traveled during the initial 3 hours at 60 mph: 3 hours * 60 mph = 180 miles.
- Next, determine how far John drove before turning around due to the forgotten item. He spent the first 2 hours stuck in traffic at 30 mph: 2 hours * 30 mph = 60 miles.
- Subtract this amount from the initial 180 miles to find out how far he was from home when he turned around: 180 miles - 60 miles = 120 miles.
- Since he tried to get home in 4 hours but only managed to cover 60 miles (the distance of the traffic), he would need to travel an additional 120 miles to reach home. However, since we're calculating how far he is from home at the end of those 4 hours, it's already accounted for by the fact that he couldn't complete the trip in 4 hours as planned due to the traffic delay.
- Therefore, John is still 120 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours. This includes the 60 miles he covered while trying"

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- In the first month, there were 60 downloads.
- In the second month, there were 3 times the first month's downloads, which is 3 * 60 = 180 downloads.
- However, these 180 downloads were reduced by 30%, meaning 70% (or 0.7) remained. So, we calculate 0.7 * 180 = 126 downloads for the second month.
- In the third month, the remaining 126 downloads were further reduced by another 30%. This time, it would be 70% of 126, calculated as 0.7 * 126 = 88.2 downloads.
- To find out the total downloads over the three months, we add up all the individual counts: 60 (first month) + 126 (second month) + 88.2 (third month) = 274.2 downloads. Since you cannot have a fraction of a download, this means that the program had approximately 274 downloads in total over the three months. However, if we need an exact count based on"

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to calculate the net profit Carlos makes per year by selling the lemons minus the expenses.
- The annual revenue from selling lemons is 7 lemons * $1.5/lemon = $10.5.
- The annual expenses are $3 for watering and feeding the tree.
- Therefore, the net profit per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.
- To find out how long it takes for Carlos to start making money, we divide the initial investment by the net profit per year.
- Carlos' initial investment is $90.
- Thus, it will take $90 / $7.5 = 12 years for Carlos to start earning money from the lemon tree.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's denote the total number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as x.
- She sold one-third of them at the green house, which is (1/3)x.
- After selling at the green house, she has (x - (1/3)x) remaining.
- Then she sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with ((x - (1/3)x) - 2).
- Finally, she sold half of the remaining ones at the orange house, which leaves her with half of the remaining ones, or (1/2)((x - (1/3)x) - 2).
- We know that this final amount equals 5, so we set up the equation: (1/2)((x - (1/3)x) - 2) = 5.
- Solving this equation gives us: (x - (1/3)x) - 2 = 10.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The value of the jewelry increases by 2.5%, which means it will become 100% + 2.5% = 102.5% of its original price.
- The value of the electronic gadgets increase by 1.2%, meaning it will be 100% + 1.2% = 101.2% of its original price.
- To find out what percentage of the original price both items are now worth, we add their respective percentages together: 102.5% + 101.2% = 203.7%.
- Therefore, the new values of the jewelry and electronics gadgets respectively will be 203.7% of their original prices.
- The profit on the jewelry purchase would then be 5000 * (203.7/100) - 5000 = $1,018.5.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, let's find out how much water was initially present in both drinks before any pouring occurred.
- Orange drink: 10 liters x (2/3) = 6.67 liters (approximately).
- Pineapple drink: 15 liters x (3/5) = 9 liters.
- Total initial amount of water: 6.67 liters + 9 liters = 15.67 liters.
- However, since you spilled one liter of the orange drink, we need to subtract that quantity from the orange drink's volume.
- Remaining orange drink: 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters.
- New total amount of water: 6.67 liters (orange drink) + 9 liters (pineapple drink) = 15.67 liters.
- Since you're adding this mixture back into the same container, the new total amount of water will remain the same, which is 15.67 liters.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- We know that Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, so if Samantha is currently 31 years old, then Raymond must be 25 years old (31 - 6).
- Raymon had a son when he was 23 years old, which means he had his son 8 years after his birth (23 - 25).
- Since Samantha is currently 31 years old, we need to calculate how many years it would take for Raymond's son to reach Samantha's current age.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The candle melted by 2 centimeters per hour.
- From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, there are 4 hours during which the candle burned.
- Therefore, the candle would melt by 2 cm/hour x 4 hours = 8 centimeters over this period.
- Thus, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter than its original length. The answer is 8 centimeters.  (Note: This calculation assumes the candle was initially longer than 8 centimeters.) If you want an exact measurement without assuming any initial length, then the answer would depend on the original length of the candle before melting began.) The question appears to contain conflicting information about whether the candle's initial length is given or not. If we assume no initial length is specified, the candle would be 8 centimeters shorter regardless of its original size since it loses 2 centimeters per hour for 4 hours. However, if an initial length is known, you need to subtract that amount from 8 centimeters to find out exactly how much shorter the candle will be.

- John sold 13 Lego sets at $15 each, which amounts to a total of 13 x $15 = $195.
- He bought 8 video games for $20 each, totaling 8 x $20 = $160.
- His initial amount was $195 (from selling Legos) minus the cost of the video games ($160), leaving him with $195 - $160 = $35.
- Since he ended up with $5 left over after buying the video games, this means he didn't spend any money on additional items beyond what was needed for the 8 video games.
- Therefore, since he initially planned to buy these 8 video games with the $35 he had left after selling his Legos, it implies that he must have already spent all $35 on the video games before selling his Legos.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- John runs 60 miles in a week over 3 days.
- He runs 3 hours on the first day.
- The remaining time (which is half an hour) is split between the second and third days.
- To find out how long he spends running each day, we divide the total hours by the number of days: 3 hours / 3 days = 1 hour per day.
- Since the last day is half an hour less than the first day, he ran 3 hours - 0.5 hours = 2.5 hours on the second day.
- Therefore, he spent 3 hours on the first day, 2.5 hours on the second day, and 1 hour on the third day.
- We add up all the hours he ran throughout the week: 3 + 2.5 + 1 = 6.5 hours.
- Finally, we calculate his speed by dividing the distance he ran by the total time he spent running: 60 miles / 6.5 hours ≈ 9.23 mph. So, John runs approximately 9.23 miles per hour.<tool_call>.

- Walking covers 4 hours * 4 mph (since she walks at 4 times the speed of running) = 16 miles.
- Therefore, in six hours, she travels 12 miles by running and 16 miles by walking, totaling 12 + 16 = 28 miles. So, Dana travels 28 miles in six hours. This concludes our calculation.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- When Polly throws without the gemstone, she can throw the gold javelin 400 feet.
- Holding the sapphire gemstone allows her to throw it three times farther, which would be 400 x 3 = 1200 feet.
- Since the dragon's reach is 1000 feet, if Polly holds the gemstone, she could theoretically throw the javelin 1200 feet away, which is beyond the dragon's reach.
- Therefore, when Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can stand up to 1200 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still hit it with the gold javelin. However, since the question asks ""how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames"", the correct answer is 1200 feet, as this is the maximum distance she could throw the javelin while still hitting the dragon. The question seems to imply that the dragon's flames are not an absolute limit on where she can stand, just a limitation on what she can throw. This interpretation may depend on additional context or assumptions about the dragon's behavior or the javelin's design. If we consider the dragon's flames as the limiting factor,"

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, let's calculate how many calories are in one serving of chips: 250 calories / 5 servings = 50 calories per serving.
- Next, we'll find out how many servings are in the entire 300g bag of chips: 300g / 100g/serving = 3 servings.
- Therefore, the total number of calories in the bag of chips is: 3 servings x 50 calories/serving = 150 calories.
- To determine how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie goal, first subtract the calories you've already consumed (1800) from your total daily calorie goal (2000): 2000 calories - 1800 calories = 200 extra calories available.
- Finally, divide these extra calories by the number of calories per gram of chips (calories/gram = 50 calories/gm), which gives us the amount of chips you can consume: 200 calories / 50 calories/gm = 4 grams of chips.
The answer is 4.<"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Charlie needs 10 pounds of beeswax and wicks to make 20 candles because he gets 10 candles per pound of wax.
- The cost for 20 candles is $10.00 since it costs $10.00 in supplies for one pound of wax and wicks.
- Charlie sells each candle for $2.00, so selling 20 candles would bring him a revenue of 20 x $2.00 = $40.00.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Candice initially had 80 post-it notes in her purse.
- She used 220 post-it notes on the cups of coffee, which means she used 80 (initial) + 220 (used) = 300 post-it notes in total.
- She had 23 post-it notes remaining, meaning she received 23 + 300 = 323 post-it notes from other sources.
- Since she already had 80 post-it notes, we need to subtract this number from the total number of post-it notes she received to find out how many were in the package she purchased.
- Therefore, the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased is 323 - 80 = 243 post-it notes. Thus, the answer is 243.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Tom's ship travels from 1 to 4 PM, which is a span of 3 hours (from 1 to 2, 2 to 3, and 3 to 4).
- During this time, Tom's ship travels at a speed of 10 miles per hour.
- The distance traveled during this period can be calculated by multiplying the speed by the time: 10 miles/hour * 3 hours = 30 miles.
- Once back at point 1, Tom starts traveling back towards point 4 at a speed of 6 mph.
- The return trip also covers a distance of 30 miles, since the distance between points 1 and 4 remains constant.
- To calculate the time taken for the return journey, we divide the distance by the speed: 30 miles / 6 mph = 5 hours.
- Therefore, it takes Tom 5 hours to get back from point 4 to point 1. This makes the total time spent on both trips 3 hours + 5 hours = 8 hours. Thus, it takes Tom 8 hours to complete the round trip. The final answer is 8 hours.  So the correct choice would be"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, let's find out how much weight the comic books take up when removed.
- Uriah removes 30 comic books and each comic book weighs 1/4 pound.
- Therefore, the total weight of the comic books removed is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.
- The original weight of all items was 15 pounds, so the remaining weight must be due to the toys.
- The remaining weight is therefore 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 pounds.
- Since each toy weighs 1/2 pound, we divide the remaining weight by the weight per toy to find out how many toys remain.
- This gives us 7.5 / (1/2) = 7.5 * 2 = 15 toys.
- Thus, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from the bag.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's calculate the earnings on Thursday first. The mechanic charges $60 per truck tire and 6 truck tires would mean a revenue of 6 * $60 = $360.
- Similarly, the mechanic charges $40 per car tire and 4 car tires would mean a revenue of 4 * $40 = $160.
- Therefore, the total revenue on Thursday was $360 (truck tires) + $160 (car tires) = $520.
- Now let's calculate the earnings on Friday. The mechanic charges $40 per car tire and 12 car tires would mean a revenue of 12 * $40 = $480.
- Since the question asks about the difference between the two days' revenues, we subtract the lower amount ($480) from the higher amount ($520).
- The difference is $520 - $480 = $40.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to find out the total weight of all the boxes and the driver/empty truck.
- We know that the truck itself weighs 3755 pounds.
- Since each box weighs 15 pounds, if x represents the number of boxes, then the total weight of the boxes would be 15x.
- Therefore, the total weight of the truck including the boxes is 3755 + 15x.
- This must be less than or equal to the bridge's capacity of 5000 pounds, as per the question statement.
- We can set up an inequality: 3755 + 15x ≤ 5000.
- Solving this equation gives us: 15x ≤ 5000 - 3755, which simplifies to 15x ≤ 1245.
- Dividing both sides by 15, we get x ≤ 83.
- Thus, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 83.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a fixed pension of $50,000 annually.
- After 20 years, starting in year 21, she starts receiving 5% of the original pension amount (which was $50,000) every year.
- Therefore, her pension increases by 5% each subsequent year until the point she stops working or retires.
- Since we're asked about quitting after 30 years, she would receive the increased pension for the remaining 10 years after reaching retirement age.
- The increase happens every year starting in the second year (year 21), so over 10 years, it adds up to 10 * 5% = 50%.
- Thus, if she quits after 30 years, her annual pension would be $50,000 + ($50,000 * 50%) = $50,000 + $25,000 = $75,000 per year. Therefore, her annual pension when she quits after 30 years would be $75,000. This assumes she continues"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to find out how many months are in the first half of the year and the second half of the year. Since there are 12 months in a year, the first half would be 6 months and the second half would also be 6 months.
- The streaming service charges Aleena $140 per month. Therefore, the initial amount for the first half of the year would be 6 months x $140/month = $840.
- However, the streaming company charged her 10% less money on the other half of the year. To find out what 10% less is, we take 10/100 x $140 = $14 discount per month.
- So, the new monthly charge for the second half of the year would be $140 - $14 = $126.
- Therefore, the total amount for the second half of the year would be 6 months x $126/month = $756.
- To get the total amount paid for the entire year, we add the amounts for both halves of the year together: $840 + $756 = $"

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The top level has an area of 16 square feet.
- Since each level has half the square footage of the level below it, we can work backwards to find the area of each level.
- Level 3 would have \( \frac{16}{2} = 8 \) square feet.
- Level 2 would have \( \frac{8}{2} = 4 \) square feet.
- And finally, Level 1 would have \( \frac{4}{2} = 2 \) square feet.
- To find the average square footage per level, add up all the levels' areas (16 + 8 + 4 + 2), then divide by the number of levels (which is 4).

- A boy then drank 6 liters of water.
- The initial amount of water was 24 liters. After subtracting what the two girls got (8 liters) and what the boy drank (6 liters), the remaining amount is calculated as follows: \(24 - 8 - 6 = 10\) liters.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's denote the number of losses as L.
- The team won 8 more games than they lost, so the number of wins W would be W = L + 8.
- We know that the total number of games played was 22, which includes both wins and losses. Therefore, we can write the equation: L + (L + 8) = 22.
- Simplifying this equation gives us 2L + 8 = 22.
- Subtracting 8 from both sides gives us 2L = 14.
- Dividing by 2 gives us L = 7.
- Since L represents the number of losses, it must be equal to 7.
- Substituting L back into the equation for wins, we get W = 7 + 8 = 15.
- Therefore, the football team won 15 games. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. 15. "

- Cindy has 4 pets.
- Marcia has 2 more pets than Cindy, which means Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.
- Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, which means Jan has 6 * 3 = 18 pets.
- The total number of pets the three have is 4 (Cindy) + 6 (Marcia) + 18 (Jan) = 28 pets. Therefore, the answer is 28. It's important to carefully read the question and pay attention to units such as ""times"" or ""more."" In this case, we need to multiply Marcia's number of pets by three since Jan has three times as many pets as Marcia. We also need to add up all the numbers together to get the final answer. Remembering these steps will help you solve similar problems effectively. It's always a good idea to double-check your calculations to ensure accuracy.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- When Freda makes tomato sauce, it loses half its volume, meaning she ends up with half as much sauce as the original amount of tomatoes.
- Since she ended up with 32 ounces of sauce, the original number of tomatoes was twice that amount, which is 32 * 2 = 64 tomatoes.
- Each can of tomatoes that she used contained three tomatoes, so the total number of tomatoes used was 64 / 3 = 21.333...
- However, since we cannot have a fraction of a tomato, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't use a partial tomato in this context.
- Therefore, Freda used 21 tomatoes from each can, totaling 21 cans worth of tomatoes (since she used one can per tomato), or 21 * 3 = 63 tomatoes in total.

- Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
- Out of these, 5 cars took an exit, leaving 30 - 5 = 25 cars behind.
- In the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars arrived, bringing the total number of cars to 25 + 20 = 45 cars.
- Since all 20 new arrivals must have driven through the traffic jam within this period, it follows that 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. This accounts for both the initial 5 cars plus the additional 15 arriving cars during those 15 minutes. Thus, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes. The other 15 cars (those who took an exit) would not have driven through the traffic jam as per the question's conditions. Therefore, 20 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's assume Henry intended to bake x number of cookies last year.
- According to the problem statement, he wanted to double this amount, which would mean he was planning on baking 2x cookies.
- However, it turns out he baked 15 more than planned, so he ended up with (2x) + 15 cookies.
- The problem states that when he dropped 5 cookies, he had a total of 110 cookies remaining.
- This means (2x) + 15 - 5 = 110.

- Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette, so he brought 2 * 5 = 10 apples.
- Kael also brought half the number of oranges than Morisette, so he brought 8 / 2 = 4 oranges.
- In total, Kael brings 10 + 4 = 14 fruits.
- Combining both their fruit amounts, they have 13 (from Morisette) + 14 (from Kael) = 27 fruits altogether. Therefore, the answer is 27 fruits.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Sadie initially slept 8 hours on Monday.
- For Tuesday and Wednesday, she slept 2 hours less each day compared to Monday, which is 8 - 2 = 6 hours.
- Therefore, on Tuesday and Wednesday combined, she slept 6 + 6 = 12 hours.
- The rest of the week (Thursday through Sunday) she slept 1 hour more than the previous days, which is 6 + 1 = 7 hours per night.
- To find out how many hours she slept during Thursday through Sunday, we multiply the number of nights by the amount she slept each night: 4 nights * 7 hours/night = 28 hours.
- Now, we add up all the hours she slept throughout the week: Monday's sleep (8 hours), Tuesday and Wednesday's sleep (12 hours), and Thursday through Sunday's sleep (28 hours).
- Total hours: 8 + 12 + 28 = 48 hours.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, let's calculate how far Rosie ran during the initial period when she was running at a speed of 10 miles per hour for 3 hours.
- Distance = Speed × Time = 10 mph × 3 hours = 30 miles.
- Next, we need to find out how long Rosie would take to cover the remaining distance if she maintained a speed of 5 miles per hour.
- Remaining time = Total time - Initial time = 7 hours - 3 hours = 4 hours.
- Distance covered by Rosie at 5 miles per hour = Speed × Time = 5 mph × 4 hours = 20 miles.
- Therefore, the total distance Rosie can run in 7 hours = Initial distance + Remaining distance = 30 miles + 20 miles = 50 miles.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let \( x \) represent the number of letters already in the stack before Jennie adds any new ones.
- Jennie stamps one-third of these letters, which amounts to \( \frac{1}{3}x \).
- Therefore, the remaining letters not yet stamped would be \( x - \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{2}{3}x \).
- We know that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the already-stamped pile.
- Thus, \( \frac{2}{3}x = 30 \).
- To find \( x \), we solve this equation by multiplying both sides by \( \frac{3}{2} \): \( x = 30 \times \frac{3}{2} = 45 \).
- This means that when Jennie began, there were 45 letters already in the stack. So, the original number of letters was 45. Hence, the answer is 45. It seems I made an error in my initial response; the correct answer is 45 letters, not 55 as previously stated. The calculation shows that if \( x = 45 \), then \("

- First, we need to calculate the number of hours each person spends waiting in line. Since each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes, this is equivalent to 24/60 = 0.4 hours per person.
- Next, we need to calculate the amount of time all patients spend waiting in line. With 500 patients every day, the total wait time is 500 * 0.4 = 200 hours.
- To find out how much the hospital makes in revenue from waiting, we multiply the wait time by the rate charged by the hospital: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30,000.
- However, since the hospital also charges the patients $200 per hour, we need to subtract the revenue generated from charging patients from the hospital's revenue: $30,000 - (500 patients * $200/hour) = $30,000 - $100,000 = -$70,000.

- Let's denote the number of queen bees by \( q \).
- According to the information given, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, which means the number of baby bees is \( 2q \).
- Also, there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, meaning the number of worker bees is \( 2 \times (2q) = 4q \).
- We know there are 700 bees in total, so we can write an equation based on this information: \( q + 2q + 4q = 700 \).
- Simplifying the left side gives us \( 7q = 700 \), then divide both sides by 7 to get \( q = 100 \).

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Jordan spends 2 hours playing video games every day.
- He works 8 hours per day on his part-time job (assuming standard workday).
- Therefore, he could potentially earn 8 * $10 = $80 per day from his job.
- In one week (7 days), he could earn $80/day * 7 days/week = $560.
- However, since he already spends 2 hours playing video games daily, those hours cannot be used for his job.
- Thus, he would not be able to use any of his gaming time towards his job earnings.
- Therefore, Jordan's weekly earning based solely on his gaming time is $0. The total amount earned over the week will still be $560 as it's solely dependent on his job income. But this calculation doesn't consider the actual usage of time between gaming and working which isn't specified here.

Let me explain it again clearly: Brittany's mom gave $8 in change back, meaning she gave $22 to pay for both tickets. Since this was half of what she actually paid, she must have given the full amount upfront, which would be $44.

- First, let's calculate how far Blake runs. He runs back and forth 15 times, which is equivalent to running the length of the field twice (once going and once coming back). The distance for one trip is 100 yards, so for 15 trips, the total distance is 15 * 100 = 1500 yards.
- Next, let's calculate how far Kelly runs. She first runs to the 40-yard line and back 34 times. This is equivalent to running the distance between the starting point and the 40-yard line, which is 100 - 40 = 60 yards per trip. Since she does this 34 times, the total distance is 34 * 60 = 2040 yards.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The initial price of a bag of marbles is $20.
- The price increase happens every two months, which means it occurs once per year.
- Therefore, after 36 months (or 18 years), there will be 18 price increases.
- A 20% increase on $20 is calculated as follows: \(20 \times 0.20 = 4\).
- This means that each time the price increases, it becomes $20 + $4 = $24.
- To find out the final price after 18 increases, we multiply the starting price by this factor 18 times: \(20 \times 2^{18}\).
- Since \(2^1 = 2\) and \(2^2 = 4\), \(2^{18} = 256\).
- Multiplying this by the starting price gives us \(20 \times 256 = 5120\).
- Thus, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost $5120.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's denote Brooke's age by \( B \).
- According to the problem, Seth is twice as old as Brooke, so Seth's age is \( 2B \).
- In 2 years, Seth's age will be \( 2B + 2 \) and Brooke's age will be \( B + 2 \).
- The sum of their ages in 2 years will be \( (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \).

- First, we need to calculate the total number of potatoes Billy needs to prep. Since he has 60 potatoes, and each potato requires both peeling and cutting time, we need to find out how many minutes it would take him to prepare all of them.
- We know that it takes Billy 1.5 minutes to peel one potato, so for 60 potatoes, it would take him 1.5 * 60 = 90 minutes to peel all of them.
- Next, we need to determine the time it takes to cut one potato. Since it takes 5 seconds to cut one potato, and we already calculated that it takes 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel one potato, we can subtract the peeling time from the total time to get the cutting time.
- Therefore, the cutting time for one potato is 90 - 90 = 0 seconds.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to find out how much Juan and Carlos earn from selling their lemonade. Since they sell 20 glasses per gallon and each glass sells for $0.50, they earn 20 * $0.50 = $10 per gallon.
- We know that they also spent $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar for each gallon, which totals to $5 per gallon.
- Therefore, the profit per gallon is the earnings minus the expenses, which is $10 - $5 = $5 per gallon.
- They made a total profit of $25, so they must have sold enough gallons to earn this amount. To find out how many gallons they sold, we divide the total profit by the profit per gallon: $25 / $5 per gallon = 5 gallons.
- Since each gallon requires $5 worth of lemons, they must have spent $5 per gallon on lemons. Over 5 gallons, this amounts to $5 * 5 = $25 on lemons.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's denote the number of white carnations Sandra ordered as W.
- According to the problem statement, Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which was five times the number of white carnations. Therefore, we can write the equation: \(200 = 5W\).
- Solving this equation gives us \(W = \frac{200}{5} = 40\). This means Sandra ordered 40 white carnations.
- Since Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses she ordered would be \(4 \times 40 = 160\).
- Thus, to keep Sandra's business, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 PM. This way, Sandra will fulfill her threat to switch suppliers if these red roses are not delivered on time. Therefore, Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses by 5 PM to avoid any disruption in their relationship. Hence, the answer is 160 red roses.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to calculate the time it takes for the slower team to complete one lap. Their first runner runs in 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. This forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of -3 (since each runner is 3 seconds slower).
- To find the sum of this arithmetic series, we use the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series: S = n/2 * (a_1 + a_n), where S is the sum, n is the number of terms, a_1 is the first term, and a_n is the last term.
- In our case, there are 4 runners, so n = 4. The first runner's time is 60 seconds, and the fourth runner's time is 60 - 3*3 = 51 seconds. We can plug these values into the formula to get S = 4/2 * (60 + 51) = 2 * 111 = 222 seconds.
- Therefore, the slower team completes one lap in 222 seconds.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, let's determine the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a single roll of a fair six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 4, 5, or 6, which gives us 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 equally likely possibilities. Therefore, the probability of this event happening is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \), or 50% chance.
- Next, we need to calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. Since an even number could be either 2, 4, or 6, the probabilities of rolling an even number on any given turn are 3/6 or 1/2. Therefore, the combined probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{2} \times \frac{1}{2} = \frac{1}{4} \), or 25% chance.

- We know that 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the rodents.
- The hamsters get 5 pieces each, so we need to divide the total by 5 to find out how many hamsters there are: 160 / 5 = 32 hamsters.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters, so we divide the number of hamsters by the number of cages to find out how many hamsters are in each cage: 32 / 10 = 3.2 hamsters per cage. Since you can't have a fraction of a rodent, let's assume this was an error and round down to 3 hamsters per cage (if all cages must contain whole numbers).
- This leaves us with 10 cages - 3 cages = 7 remaining cages for the rats.
- We know each rat gets 6 pieces of straw, so we divide the total number of pieces of straw by the number of rats: 160 / 7 = approximately 22.857 rats.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The trader makes a profit of $400 on selling all the bags.
- Let's assume the trader sold 'x' number of bags.
- The transportation cost for each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost for x bags would be 2x dollars.
- The selling price of each bag is $30, so the total revenue from selling x bags would be 30x dollars.
- The total cost (including buying and transporting) for x bags would be 20x + 2x = 22x dollars.
- Therefore, the profit equation would be Revenue - Cost = Profit, or 30x - (20x + 2x) = 400.

Conditionality refers to the relationship between variables where one variable's value affects another variable's probability distribution. When we consider conditionality, we are able to identify patterns or dependencies within the data that might otherwise go unnoticed. This helps us to reduce noise by allowing us to make better predictions and draw accurate conclusions based on our analysis. In other words, when we take into account the relationships between different variables, we are able to filter out irrelevant information and focus on what truly matters.

- After a month, she collected three times that number, which is 20 * 3 = 60 cards.
- In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which is 60 - 20 = 40 cards.
- In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which is (60 + 40) * 2 = 200 cards.
- To find out how many Pokemon cards Elaine has now in total, we add all the collections together: 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to determine how many sentences Mark edits from each publisher. Since he edits an equal number of sentences each week, we divide the total by two: 1000 / 2 = 500 sentences per week.
- Next, we calculate how much Publisher A pays him per week. As it's given that Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, we multiply this amount by the total number of sentences edited: 5 cents/sentence * 500 sentences/week = 2500 cents/week.
- Finally, since Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A, we double the amount paid by Publisher A: 2500 cents/week * 2 = 5000 cents/week.
- Therefore, Mark makes 5000 cents in a week from editing for both publishers combined. The answer is 5000 cents.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, calculate John's new weekly salary after the 5% raise: \(2000 \times (1 + 0.05) = 2000 \times 1.05 = 2100\).
- Since John gets paid once a week throughout the entire year, we need to multiply his weekly salary by the number of weeks in a year, which is typically considered to be 52 weeks: \(2100 \times 52 = 109200\).
- Next, add the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to this amount: \(109200 + 5000 = 114200\).
- Therefore, John made $114,200 during that year. However, if you're asking about the additional income due to the raise, it would be $10,920 per week or $538,400 for the whole year based on his regular weekly pay ($2100 x 52 weeks).

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Carl used 2 slices of cheese for each sandwich. Since he had a sandwich for lunch every day this week (which is 7 days), he would have used \(2 \times 7 = 14\) slices of cheese for sandwiches.
- Carl ate 3 days of omelets and used one more slice per omelet compared to the number of slices used per sandwich. The number of slices used per omelet is 2 plus 1 which equals 3 slices. Therefore, for 3 days of omelets, he would have used \(3 \times 3 = 9\) slices of cheese.
- In addition to the omelets, he also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese that used 8 slices of cheese.
- Adding all these up gives us \(14 + 9 + 8 = 31\) slices of cheese used in total by Carl during the week.

- First, let's add up all the scores Brinley has received so far: 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448.
- Let x represent the score Brinley needs on the sixth test.
- The sum of the six test scores will then be 448 + x.
- Since Brinley wants to have an average of 93, we set up this equation: (448 + x) / 6 = 93.
- To solve for x, multiply both sides by 6: 448 + x = 558.
- Subtract 448 from both sides: x = 110.
- Therefore, Brinley needs a score of 110 on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93. The final answer is 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110. 110"

- First, let's calculate the cost of half a dozen plates: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 6000 = 3000 \) dollars.
- The problem states that twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates. Let's denote the cost of one cup as \( x \). Therefore, the cost of twenty dozen cups would be \( 20x \).
- According to the given information, we have: \( 20x = 3000 - 1200 \), which simplifies to \( 20x = 1800 \).
- Solving for \( x \): \( x = \frac{1800}{20} = 90 \) dollars per cup.
- Thus, the total cost of buying each cup is \( \$90 \). (Note: This calculation assumes that the price of a cup doesn't change.)

- Let's assume the number of red chickens is R and the number of white chickens is W.
- According to the information given, we know that W = R + 2 (two more white chickens than red).
- We also know that the total number of eggs collected daily is 42, which is the sum of the eggs produced by red and white chickens.
- Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from red chickens is 3R.
- White chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so the total number of eggs from white chickens is 5W.
- Therefore, 3R + 5W = 42.
- Substituting W with R + 2 gives us: 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42.
- Simplifying this equation gives us: 3R + 5R + 10 = 42.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( x \) gallons.
- The big pool currently holds four times as much water as the small pool, so it has \( 4x \) gallons.
- Both pools leak at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Since 4 minutes ago, the pools leaked a combined total of \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.
- Therefore, the current amounts of water in both pools minus the leakage over 4 minutes must equal their original amounts plus the leakage over 4 minutes.
- This gives us the equation: \( 4x - 16 = 2(x - 16) \).
- Simplifying this equation, we get: \( 4x - 16 = 2x - 32 \), which simplifies further to \( 2x = -16 \), or \( x = -8 \).

- According to the information given, John has twice as many candies as Robert, which means John has 2R candies.
- We know that John has 54 candies, so we can write the equation: 2R = 54.
- Solving this equation gives us: R = 54 / 2 = 27.
- This means Robert has 27 candies.
- Since James has 6 more candies than Robert, James has 27 + 6 = 33 candies.
- To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54 - 33 = 21.
The answer is 21.<"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Dolly has 2 books (her own and the other book).
- Pandora also has 1 book (her own).
- Together, they initially have a total of 2 (from Dolly) + 1 (from Pandora) = 3 books.
- Since Dolly reads both her own and Pandora's books, she would count them twice if we just add the initial counts together.
- Therefore, by the end, they will have collectively read 3 (initially counted) + 1 (counted again because Dolly reads both her own and Pandora's) = 4 books. But since Dolly counts her own book once and Pandora's book once, they actually have read 3 unique books in total. So the correct answer is 3 books. They have collectively read 3 books by the end. It's important not to double-count any books that appear in both collections. This way, they have read 3 unique books in total. The first step was to understand that they initially had 3 books combined (2 from Dolly and 1 from Pandora), but then when Dolly reads her own book and Pandora's book, it becomes clear that they only have 3 unique books. So the"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Mike had 5 pen pals initially, but he stopped being pen pals with 2 of them. This leaves him with 5 - 2 = 3 pen pals.
- Each pen pal sends 2 letters a week, which totals 3 x 2 = 6 letters per week.
- Each letter is 5 pages long, so he writes 6 x 5 = 30 pages per week.
- Since he can write one page every 6 minutes, it will take him 30 x 6 = 180 minutes to write all the letters.
- There are 60 minutes in an hour, so this equals 180 / 60 = 3 hours spent writing a week. Therefore, Mike spends 3 hours writing a week. The answer is 3.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss every month. Since he makes one 15-minute call daily, over 30 days, he would spend 15 * 30 = 450 minutes calling his boss.
- Next, add up all the minutes used throughout the month. This includes the time spent on calls with his boss (450) plus the additional 300 minutes he spent elsewhere. Therefore, the total minutes used this month would be 450 + 300 = 750 minutes.
- Finally, subtract the total minutes used from the monthly limit of 1000 minutes. So, 1000 - 750 = 250 minutes remaining for Jason this month. Thus, Jason has 250 minutes left for this month. The answer is 250.</tool_call>.
-contributor (me) - I apologize, my previous response contained an error. Let me correct it for you. To find out how many minutes Jason has left, we need to consider both the calls made to his boss and any additional calls. Since Jason makes one 15-minute call daily,"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Initially, Griffin had 24 fries.
- Kyle took 5 fries, leaving Griffin with \( 24 - 5 = 19 \) fries.
- Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \). This leaves Griffin with \( 19 - 10 = 9 \) fries.
- Ginger gave Griffin some fries such that in the end, Griffin had 27 fries. Therefore, before Ginger's contribution, Griffin had \( 27 - 9 = 18 \) fries.
- Colby took 3 less than Kyle had taken, which is \( 5 - 3 = 2 \) fries. This means before Colby took his share, Griffin had \( 18 + 2 = 20 \) fries.
- Since we know Griffin initially had 24 fries, and before Colby took his share, he had 20 fries, it means Ginger must have given him an additional \( 24 - 20 = 4 \) fries.
The answer is 4.<"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let's assume the number of fish in each aquarium is x.
- The total number of fish in both aquariums is therefore 2x (since there are 2 aquariums).
- According to the problem, this total is equal to the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums, which is 32 - 4 = 28.
- Therefore, we can set up the equation 2x = 28.
- Solving for x gives us x = 28 / 2 = 14.
- So there are 14 fish in each aquarium.
The answer is 14.<"
"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Jeans' makeup artist charges $250 per hour.
- It takes 6 hours to do makeup each day, so it costs 6 * $250 = $1500 per day.
- She needs this done 4 times a week, so it's $1500 * 4 = $6000 per week.
- The movie takes 5 weeks to complete, so it costs $6000 * 5 = $30,000 in total before any discounts.
- She gets a 10% discount on the entire bill, which amounts to 10/100 * $30,000 = $3,000.
- Therefore, the final amount Jean paid is $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000. So, Jean paid $27,000 after the discount. The answer is 27000.<tool_call>.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- First, we need to add up all the costs Isabelle incurred: $12 (cake) + $43 (presents) + $15 (decorations) + $4 (invitations) + $22 (goodie bags) = $96.
- Since she split this amount evenly among herself and her two parents, we divide the total by 3: $96 ÷ 3 = $32.
- Therefore, each person paid $32.

- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies, so she ate 4*5=20 cookies.
- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday, which means she ate 20*4=80 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate 13*1=13 cookies.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday, which means she ate 13*2=26 cookies.
- In total, Sue ate 80+26=106 cookies.
- Her sister ate 5+13=18 cookies.
- The difference between their calorie intake is 106-18=88 calories.
