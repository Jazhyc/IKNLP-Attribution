" Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day.

"The value of the house increased by 50,000 because it increased 150% from his initial purchase price. So the increase in value of the house is worth 50,000.

Adding this to the original cost gives us 50,000 + 80,000 = 130,000 dollars.

Because the repair cost increased the value of the house by 150%, we can find the amount of money spent on repairs by multiplying the increase in value by 150%. That means Josh spent 50,000 / 1.5 = 33,333 dollars on repairs.

Finally, subtracting the repair cost from the final value of the house gives us a profit of 130,000 - 33,333 = 96,667 dollars.

" Carlos needs to calculate how long it will take him to make back the initial cost of the tree. Let's start by calculating his annual income from selling lemons.

He sells each lemon for $1.5, so if he gets 7 lemons each year, he makes 7 * $1.5 = $10.5 per year from selling lemons.

However, we also have to consider the yearly expenses of $3 to water and feed the tree. So, his net income per year after expenses is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.

Now, let's calculate how many years it will take him to earn back the initial cost of the tree. We do this by dividing the initial cost of the tree ($90) by his net annual income ($7.5). 

So, it will take him $90 / $7.5 = 12 years to earn back the initial cost of the tree.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let V be the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.
She sold V/3 at the green house, leaving V - V/3 = 2V/3 vacuums.
After selling 2 more to the red house, she had (2V/3) - 2 vacuums left.
Half of this amount would be (2V/3) - 2/2 = V/3 vacuums at the orange house.
Since these were the last 5 vacuums she had, we have V/3 = 5.
Thus, Melanie started with V = 5 * 3 = 15 vacuums.

" First, let's find out how many students enrolled in contemporary dance. Since 20% of the 20 students enrolled in contemporary dance, we can calculate this number as follows:

$$
\text{Contemporary Dance} = 20 \times 0.20 = 4
$$

So, there are 4 students who enrolled in contemporary dance.

Next, let's find out how many students were left after accounting for those who enrolled in contemporary dance. This is done by subtracting the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students:

$$
\text{Remaining} = 20 - 4 = 16
$$

Then, let's find out how many students enrolled in jazz dance. Since 25% of the remaining 16 students enrolled in jazz dance, we can calculate this number as follows:

$$
\text{Jazz Dance} = 16 \times 0.25 = 4
$$

So, there are 4 students who enrolled in jazz dance.

Finally, to find out how many students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we simply subtract the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and jazz dance from the total number of students:

$$
\text{Hip-Hop Dance} = 20 - (4 + 4) = 20 - 8 = 12
$$

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we divide the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance by the total number of students and multiply by 100:

$$
\frac{\text{Hip-Hop Dance}}{\text{Total Students}} \times 100 = \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60%
$$

Therefore, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance.

"To determine the optimal purchase plan, we need to calculate the profit made from both options.

For jewelry:

Cost = $5,000
Expected increase = 2.5%
Profit from Jewelry = Cost * (1 + Expected increase) - Cost

For electronics:

Cost = $8,000
Expected increase = 1.2%
Profit from Electronics = Cost * (1 + Expected increase) - Cost

Let's calculate the profits for both options:

Jewelry Profit = $5,000 * (1 + 2.5%) - $5,000 = $5,000 * 1.025 - $5,000 = $5,000 * 1.025 - $5,000
Electronics Profit = $8,000 * (1 + 1.2%) - $8,000 = $8,000 * 1.012 - $8,000 = $8,000 * 1.012 - $8,000

Now, let's perform the calculations:

Jewelry Profit = $5,000 * 1.025 - $5,000 = $5,250 - $5,000 = $250
Electronics Profit = $8,000 * 1.012 - $8,000 = $8,080 - $8,000 = $800

Comparing the two options, the jewelry option gives a higher profit of $250 compared to the electronics option of $800. Therefore, the merchant should choose the jewelry option to maximize his profit at the end of the month."

"To find out how much water is in the remaining 24 liters, we first calculate the amount of water in both drinks before the spill.

For the orange drink:
\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = 2 \times \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{3} \]
\[ \text{Total volume of orange drink} = 10 \]
\[ \text{Volume of water in orange drink} = \frac{4}{3} \times 10 = \frac{40}{3} \]

For the pineapple drink:
\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = 3 \times \frac{3}{5} = \frac{9}{5} \]
\[ \text{Total volume of pineapple drink} = 15 \]
\[ \text{Volume of water in pineapple drink} = \frac{9}{5} \times 15 = \frac{135}{5} = 27 \]

Before the spill, the total volume of the drinks together is \(10 + 15 = 25\) liters.

After the spill, there are now \(25 - 1 = 24\) liters of drinks combined.

The amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is the sum of the water from the orange and pineapple drinks after the spill:

\[ \text{Total water after spill} = \frac{40}{3} + 27 = \frac{40}{3} + \frac{81}{3} = \frac{121}{3} \]

Therefore, there is \(\frac{121}{3}\) or approximately 40.33 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of drink.

"Let's denote the cost of the boots as \(B\) and the cost of the second pair of high heels as \(H\). We know from the problem statement:

1. The total cost of the boots and the second pair of high heels is $5 less than the boots' price, so we can write this as \(B + H = B - 5\).
2. One pair of heels costs $33, so \(H = 33\).
3. The other pair of heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so \(H = 2 \times 33 = 66\).

Substituting the value of \(H\) into the equation gives us \(B + 66 = B - 5\), which simplifies to \(B + 66 = B - 5\). Solving for \(B\) gives us \(66 = -5\), but this doesn't make sense because you can't have negative money.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding here. Let's correct it:

We know the total cost of the boots and the second pair of high heels is $5 less than the boots' price. This means the total cost is \(B + H = B - 5\).

Given that one pair of heels costs $33, and another pair costs twice as much (i.e., $66), we substitute these values into our equation:

\(B + 66 = B - 5\)

Solving for \(B\):

\(66 + 5 = B + B\)

\(71 = 2B\)

\(B = 35.5\)

Therefore, the boots cost $35.50."
"The current age of Darrell is 7/18 of his total age while Allen's age is 11/18 of his total age.

Given that their combined total age is 162,

Let the present age of Darrell and Allen be D and A respectively.

Therefore,
D/A = 7/18
A/D = 11/18

Multiplying these equations gives us,
(D/A)*(A/D) = (7/18)*(11/18)
(19/18)*D = (77/18)

Solving this equation gives us D = 77/(19/18) = 13.5 years old.

Thus, Allen's current age is A = 162 - D = 162 - 13.5 = 148.5 years old.

Hence, Allen's age after 10 years will be A + 10 = 148.5 + 10 = 158.5 years.

"To solve this problem, we first determine Dana's speed while running and while skipping.

Given:
- Speed when running = \(4 \times\) Speed when walking
- Speed when skipping = \(1/2\) Speed when running

Let's denote the speed when walking as \(w\). Then, the speed when running would be \(4w\), and the speed when skipping would be \(2w\).

We know that Dana skips at 3 mph. So, we have:
\[2w = 3\]
Solving for \(w\):
\[w = 3 / 2 = 1.5 \text{ mph}\]

Now, let's find the distances traveled:

- Running distance (in one third of the time):
\[Distance_{running} = \frac{Speed_{running}}{\text{Time}_{running}} = \frac{4w}{\frac{1}{3}} = 4w \times \frac{3}{1} = 12w = 12 \times 1.5 = 18 \text{ miles}\]

- Walking distance (in two thirds of the time):
\[Distance_{walking} = \frac{Speed_{walking}}{\text{Time}_{walking}} = \frac{w}{\frac{2}{3}} = w \times \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \times 3 = 4.5 \text{ miles}\]

Adding both distances gives us the total distance Dana travels in six hours:
Total Distance = \(18 + 4.5 = 22.5 \text{ miles}\)

Therefore, Dana can travel 22.5 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

"To find out how many grams of chips you can eat based on your daily calorie target and the amount you've already consumed, let's first calculate the total number of calories you're aiming to consume.

Given:
- Daily calorie target: 2000 calories
- Amount already consumed: 1800 calories

Total calories you aim to consume: \(2000 \text{ calories}\)

You've already consumed: \(1800 \text{ calories}\)

Remaining calories to consume: \(2000 \text{ calories} - 1800 \text{ calories} = 200 \text{ calories}\)

Now, knowing that a 300g bag contains 5 servings, we'll determine how many grams you can safely eat from this bag without exceeding your daily calorie limit.

First, calculate the total calories per gram of chips:

\[ \frac{250 \text{ calories}}{1} = 250 \text{ calories per gram} \]

Next, divide the remaining calories you need (200) by the calories per gram to find out how many grams of chips you can eat:

\[ \frac{200}{250} = 0.8 \text{ grams} \]

Therefore, you can safely eat 0.8 grams of chips to meet your daily calorie target while still allowing you to exceed it by consuming 200 calories above your goal. Keep in mind that this calculation assumes you will not exceed your daily calorie intake with the 0.8 grams eaten. It's important to ensure that the ratio between the calories consumed and the daily target allows for the possibility of reaching or exceeding the target."

\[48 \div 6 = 8\]

Therefore, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire from the original 4-foot wire.

" Richard's building has 15 floors, and each floor has 8 units, so there are a total of 15 * 8 = 120 units.
If 3/4 of the building is occupied, then the number of occupied units is 120 * (3/4) = 90 units.
To find the number of unoccupied units, we subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units: 120 - 90 = 30 units.
The answer is $\boxed{30}$."

" Each comic book weighs 1/4 pound, so if Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books is 30 * (1/4) = 7.5 pounds.
The total weight of the toys is 7.5 pounds because we don't know the weight of each toy yet.
Let's say the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is T. Each toy weighs 1/2 pound, so the total weight of the toys is T * (1/2) = T/2 pounds.
We want the total weight of the comics and toys combined to be less than or equal to 15 pounds, so we have the equation 7.5 + T/2 <= 15.
To solve this inequality, we first subtract 7.5 from both sides to get T/2 <= 7.5.
Then we multiply both sides by 2 to get T <= 15.
So the number of toys Uriah needs to remove is less than or equal to 15.
However, since we don't know the exact weight of each toy, we can't determine exactly how many toys Uriah needs to remove. The question doesn't provide enough information to calculate the exact number of toys.

"To find the total number of kittens the family has, let's break down the information given:

- The first cat, Patchy, has had thrice the number of adopted kittens compared to the second cat, Trixie.
- Trixie has had 12 kittens.

First Cat (Patchy): 
If we denote the number of kittens Patchy has as \(P\), it follows that \(P = 3 \times 12\). Therefore, \(P = 36\) kittens.

Second Cat (Trixie): 
Since Trixie has 12 kittens, this means the total number of kittens from both Patchy and Trixie equals \(12 + 36 = 48\) kittens.

Adding the original 7 kittens they already had:
Total kittens = \(48 + 7 = 55\).

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 55 kittens.

"To find out the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first calculate the total weight capacity of the truck and then determine how many boxes can fit within this limit.

The truck itself weighs 3755 pounds, including its driver. Since each box weighs 15 pounds, the maximum weight the truck can carry without exceeding its own weight is:

\[ \text{Max Weight} = \text{Truck's Weight} + (\text{Number of Boxes}) \times \text{Box Weight} \]

Substituting the known values:

\[ \text{Max Weight} = 3755 + (15 \times \text{Number of Boxes}) \]

We know the bridge can hold up to 5000 pounds. To avoid exceeding this limit, the number of boxes must be less than or equal to:

\[ \frac{\text{Max Weight}}{\text{Box Weight}} \leq 5000 \]

Let's substitute \( \text{Max Weight} \) back into our equation:

\[ \frac{3755 + (15 \times \text{Number of Boxes})}{15} \leq 5000 \]

Solving for the Number of Boxes:

\[ 3755 + 15 \times \text{Number of Boxes} \leq 5000 \times 15 \]
\[ 15 \times \text{Number of Boxes} \leq 5000 \times 15 - 3755 \]
\[ 15 \times \text{Number of Boxes} \leq 75000 - 3755 \]
\[ 15 \times \text{Number of Boxes} \leq 71245 \]
\[ \text{Number of Boxes} \leq \frac{71245}{15} \]
\[ \text{Number of Boxes} \leq 4549.333... \]

Given that the number of boxes must be an integer, we round down to get the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit:

\[ \text{Maximum Number of Boxes} = 4549 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is **4549**.

Including coaches, each school sends a total of \(20 + 4 = 24\) people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people from all schools is \(4 \times 24 = 96\).

" The treasure hunter found 175 diamonds.

The number of rubies is 35 fewer than the number of diamonds. So if we let $x$ represent the number of diamonds, then the number of rubies is $x - 35$. We know this equals 35, so we can set up the equation $x - 35 = 35$, and solve for $x$:

$x = 35 + 35 = 70$

So there are 70 rubies.

The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. So if we let $y$ represent the number of rubies, then the number of emeralds is $2y$. We know this equals the number of rubies plus the number of diamonds, so we have $2y = 70 + 175 = 245$. Solving for $y$, we get:

$y = \frac{245}{2} = 122.5$

But the number of emeralds must be a whole number, so there must be an error in our calculation. Let's go back and check our work.

We know that the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. If we let $z$ represent the number of rubies, then the number of emeralds is $2z$. But we also know that the number of emeralds is equal to the sum of the number of diamonds and rubies, so $2z = 175 + z$. Rearranging terms gives us $z = 175 + z$, which simplifies to $z = 175$. 

So there are actually 175 rubies.

Now we can find the number of emeralds. Since the number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies, and there are 175 rubies, the number of emeralds is $2 \times 175 = 350$.

Finally, to find the total number of gems, we add up the number of diamonds, rubies, and emeralds: $175 + 175 + 350 = 620$.

So there are 620 gems in the chest.

"Let's start with the number of students. Since there are 60 girls and 5 students per teacher, we can find the total number of students by multiplying the number of girls by 5.

\[ \text{Total Students} = 60 \times 5 = 300 \]

Now, let's determine the number of boys based on the given ratio (boys to girls being twice). Since there are 60 girls, the number of boys would be:

\[ \text{Number of Boys} = 60 \times 2 = 120 \]

To find the total number of students including both boys and girls, we add them together:

\[ \text{Total Students} = \text{Boys} + \text{Girls} = 120 + 60 = 180 \]

Finally, to find the number of teachers, we divide the total number of students by the number of students per teacher:

\[ \text{Number of Teachers} = \frac{\text{Total Students}}{\text{Students per Teacher}} = \frac{180}{5} = 36 \]

Therefore, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school.

"To find the average square footage of a level, we first calculate the total square footage of all levels and then divide it by the number of levels.

Given:
- The top level (the fourth level) has a square footage of 16 square feet.
- Each level has half the square footage of the level below it.

The bottom level would have \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \) square feet because each level is half the size of the one above it.

The second level would have \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) square feet.

And the third level would have \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) square feet.

Adding these together gives us the total square footage of all levels:

\[ 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \]

Now, to find the average, we divide this total by the number of levels:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total square footage}}{\text{Number of levels}} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \]

Therefore, the average square footage of a level is 7.5 square feet.

We know that James is 10, and if we let \(C = 11\) (since James is 1 year younger than Corey), then we get \(J = 10\). Using \(A = C - 2\) with \(C = 11\), we find \(A = 9\). But this doesn't directly help us determine Jackson's age because \(A\) depends on both Jackson's age and Amy's age.

If we consider the original statement about Amy being 5 years older than Jackson and Amy being 2 years younger than Corey, but without any specific relation between these ages and Jackson's, we cannot deduce Jackson's exact age solely from this information alone. The information provided appears to be insufficient for accurately determining Jackson's age based on the details given. 

However, if we were to proceed under the assumption that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson and Amy is 2 years younger than Corey, we would infer that Corey must also be 5 years older than Jackson, making Jackson the youngest among them at 5 years old. Given the context of the problem, it is likely intended that Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, but without additional constraints or clarification, we cannot definitively state Jackson's age based on the information given.

In conclusion, based on the information provided, it's not clear how to calculate Jackson's age, considering that the information about Amy's and Corey's ages doesn't directly correlate to Jackson's age when Amy and Corey's ages are known. More context or additional information is needed to solve the problem as stated.

" If Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald, and Lee runs them in 38 seconds, then it means that Gerald runs them in 38+2 = 40 seconds.
If Gerald's speed improves by 10%, we need to calculate the new time it takes him to run the 400-meter hurdles.
To do this, we multiply his original time by 1 plus the percentage improvement: 40 * (1 + 0.1) = 40 * 1.1 = 44 seconds.
So, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 44 seconds.
The answer is $\boxed{44}$."
" The number of pet dogs is given as 60. According to the problem, the number of cats is two times the number of dogs, so the number of cats is \(2 \times 60 = 120\).
The combined number of pet dogs and cats is therefore \(60 + 120 = 180\).
The problem also states that the number of rabbits (pet pets) is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats. So, the number of rabbits is \(180 - 12 = 168\).
To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together, which is \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).
Therefore, the total number of pets in the neighborhood is 348.

" Out of the 200 Grade 5 students, 2/5 are boys, so there are 200 * 2/5 = 80 boys.
The rest of the students must be girls, so there are 200 - 80 = 120 girls.
If 2/3 of the girls are in the Girl Scout, then there are 120 * 2/3 = 80 girls in the Girl Scout.
To find the number of girls not in the Girl Scout, we subtract the number of girls in the Girl Scout from the total number of girls: 120 - 80 = 40.
Therefore, there are 40 girls who are not in the Girl Scout.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used from her last batch of tomato sauce, we first need to determine how many cans (which represent whole tomatoes) she used.

The sauce she makes contains 3 tomatoes per can. Since she made 32 ounces of sauce, let's calculate the number of cans she used:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{\text{Total ounces of sauce}}{\text{Tomatoes per can}} = \frac{32}{3} \]

Now, let's perform this calculation:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{32}{3} = 10\text{ cans with remainder }2\text{ ounces} \]

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, we multiply the number of cans by 3 to find the total number of tomatoes:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes} = \text{Number of cans} \times 3 = 10 \times 3 = 30 \]

Freda used 30 tomatoes from her last batch of tomato sauce.

Therefore, the answer is **30**.

"In the first 15 minutes, 5 cars took an exit instead of driving through the traffic jam. So, the number of cars that actually drove through the traffic jam is 5.
The original number of cars on the motorway was 30. After 5 cars took an exit, the number of cars that remained on the motorway is 30 - 5 = 25 cars.
We know that 20 more cars drove through in the remaining 15 minutes. So, the total number of cars that drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes is 25 + 20 = 45 cars.

" Mary initially had 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges, so she had a total of \(2 \times 40 = 80\) potted plants.

She received 18 new potted plants from the nursery, so now she has \(80 + 18 = 98\) potted plants.

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to her friends and family tomorrow. This means she will give away \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants.

To find out how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we subtract the number of potted plants she gives away from the total number of potted plants she has now. So, \(98 - 40 = 58\).

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants.

"The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. Since Jerome's first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times, the second friend pressed on the doorbell \(20 + \frac{1}{4} \times 20\).

The second friend therefore pressed on the doorbell \(20 + \frac{20}{4} = 20 + 5 = 25\) times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times, the third friend pressed on the doorbell \(60 + 10 = 70\) times.

To find the total number of doorbell rings made by all four friends, we add up the individual totals:

Total doorbell rings = First friend's total + Second friend's total + Third friend's total + Fourth friend's total

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60\)

Total doorbell rings = \(20 + 25 + 70 + 60 = 195\)

Therefore, the doorbell rang 195 times.

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the area of the city.

Given that the fog bank covers every 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can find the time required to cover one mile by dividing the time by the distance:

\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{\text{Time}}{\text{Distance}} = \frac{10\, \text{minutes}}{3\, \text{miles}} = \frac{10}{3}\, \text{minutes/mile} \]

Next, we know the city is 42 miles wide. To find the time required to cover the entire city, we multiply the time per mile by the width of the city:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time per mile} \times \text{Width} = \left(\frac{10}{3}\right) \times 42\, \text{minutes} \]

Let's calculate this:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \frac{10}{3} \times 42 = \frac{420}{3} = 140\, \text{minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the entire city.

" Frankie watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night from Monday to Tuesday, so that's 2 days x 1 hour/day = 2 hours.
On Wednesday, he watched a few episodes of a 30-minute show, let's say he watched \(x\) of them.
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so that's 1 hour + 30 minutes = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours.
In total, he watched 2 hours (Monday to Tuesday) + 1.5 hours (Wednesday) + 1 hour (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 6.5 hours.
If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, then he must have watched 7 - 6.5 = 0.5 hours worth of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.
To find out how many 30-minute shows he watched, we divide the number of hours by the length of each episode: 0.5 hours / 30 minutes = 0.01666... episodes.
Rounded to one decimal place, he watched approximately 0.02 episodes on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \(x\). According to the problem:

1. This year, he plans to make twice as many as last year, so this would be \(2x\).
2. But he accidentally makes 15 more cookies than intended, meaning he made \(2x + 15\) cookies this year.

He then drops 5 cookies while putting them out to cool, leaving him with \(2x + 15 - 5 = 110\) cookies. So we can set up the equation:

\[2x + 10 = 110\]

Solving for \(x\), we subtract 10 from both sides:

\[2x = 110 - 10\]
\[2x = 100\]

Divide both sides by 2 to find \(x\):

\[x = \frac{100}{2}\]
\[x = 50\]

Therefore, Henry baked 50 cookies last year.

Given that the boat takes on 2 liters of water for every 10 feet it rows, and knowing that the distance from the start point to the end (the shore) is 64 seconds or 64/16 = 4 sets of 10 feet, we can determine how much water was added:

\[ \text{Water added} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Rate}} = \frac{4 \times 10}{2} = 20 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, the boat had taken on 20 liters of water before Julia arrived at the shore.

" Sasha bought ten 2x4x10 lumber boards at $10 each, so she spent 10 * $10 = $100 on those.
She also bought five 4x4x10 lumber boards at $16 each, so she spent 5 * $16 = $80 on those.
In total, she spent $100 + $80 = $180 on lumber.
If the price for lumber went up 50%, then the new price is $100 + ($100 * 0.5) = $150 per board.
She has ten 2x4x10 lumber boards, so she can sell them for 10 * $150 = $1500.
And she has five 4x4x10 lumber boards, so she can sell them for 5 * $150 = $750.
Adding these together, she will make $1500 + $750 = $2250 if she sells all her lumber.
To find the profit, we subtract the amount she spent from the amount she made: $2250 - $180 = $2070.

"If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it increased by 40%, we can find out his current salary:

$40000 + ($40000 * 40%) = $40000 + ($40000 * 0.4) = $40000 + $16000 = $56000.

Now, if Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's, we can find out Lylah's salary:

Let's say Lylah's salary four years ago was X. Then, according to the information, Adrien's salary (which is $56000) is 30% higher than X, so:

X + 0.30X = $56000

Combining like terms gives us:

1.30X = $56000

Dividing both sides by 1.30 gives us:

X = $56000 / 1.30 = $43076.923,

which rounds to $43077 because salaries are typically rounded to the nearest whole number.

Therefore, the combined total salary they were receiving four years later is:

"Let's denote the number of queen bees as \(Q\). According to the information:

1. There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of baby bees is \(2Q\).
2. There are twice as many baby bees as queen bees, so the number of worker bees is \(2 \times 2Q = 4Q\).

We know there are 700 bees in total, and we can express this as:

\[Q + 2Q + 4Q = 700\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[7Q = 700\]

To find \(Q\), divide both sides by 7:

\[Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100\]

Now, knowing there are 100 queen bees, we can calculate the number of worker bees:

\[4Q = 4 \times 100 = 400\]

Therefore, there are 400 worker bees in the hive.

"To find out how long Steve will take to reach school, we multiply the distance (3 miles) by Steve’s biking speed (440 feet per minute). So, Steve takes \(3 \times 440 = 1320\) feet to travel to school.

Given that Steve bikes at 440 feet per minute, it would take him \(1320 \div 440 = 3\) minutes to reach school.

For Tim, who lives 2 miles away from the school, we multiply the distance (2 miles) by his skating speed (264 feet per minute), which gives us \(2 \times 264 = 528\) feet to travel to school.

Therefore, it will take Tim \(528 \div 440 = 1.2\) minutes to reach school.

To find out how long Steve and Tim will wait until one of them finishes the race, we subtract Tim's time from Steve's time because Steve has a longer distance to cover. That is \(3 - 1.2 = 1.8\) minutes.

"Let's denote the number of French fries Dave initially had as \(F\).

From the information given:

1. Dave ate 14 French fries before the seagull took them.
2. The seagull ate half of what Dave ate, so the seagull ate \(\frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7\) French fries.
3. Three pigeons ate \(3 \times 3 = 9\) French fries, bringing the total to \(F - 14 - 7 - 9 = F - 30\).
4. Two thirds of this remaining amount were stolen by a raccoon, so \(2/3 \times (F - 30) = 2/3(F - 30)\), and after this theft, there were \(F - 30 - 2/3(F - 30)\) fries left.
5. Ants carried off one French fry, leaving five behind.

The equation representing these conditions is \(F - 30 - 2/3(F - 30) - 1 = 5\). Simplifying this gives us \(F - 30 - \frac{2}{3}(F - 30) - 1 = 5\).

Multiplying through by 3 to clear fractions gives \(3F - 90 - 2(F - 30) - 3 = 15\).

Expanding and simplifying further yields \(3F - 90 - 2F + 60 - 3 = 15\),

Which simplifies to \(F - 30 = 15\).

Adding 30 to both sides gives \(F = 45\).

Therefore, Dave originally had 45 French fries in the pack when he bought it.

3. Convert baguettes from feet to inches:
\[ \text{Baguettes} = 60 \times 12 \text{ inches} = 720 \text{ inches} \]
\[ \text{Baguettes} = 720 \div 12 = 60 \text{ feet} \]

Now, add them together to get the total length:

" The zookeeper feeds all the apes in the zoo, so we need to find the total number of bananas needed for all the apes.

The gorillas need 400 bananas every month, and they need to feed for 2 months, so the gorillas need 400 * 2 = 800 bananas.

The baboons need 100 bananas every month, and they also need to feed for 2 months, so the baboons need 100 * 2 = 200 bananas.

Adding up the bananas needed for the gorillas and the baboons, we get 800 + 200 = 1000 bananas.

Now, let's add the bananas needed for the apes. We know that the apes need 200 bananas every month, and they need to feed for 2 months, so the apes need 200 * 2 = 400 bananas.

Finally, adding up the bananas needed for the gorillas, the baboons, and the apes gives us 1000 + 400 = 1400 bananas.

So the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

He caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, so he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.

The total number of fish Locsin caught is 5 + 3 + 5 = 13.

To find the total number of fish they both caught, we add the number of fish Anakin caught to the number of fish Locsin caught: 19 (Anakin) + 13 (Locsin) = 32.

"To find the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months (which is six time periods), we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial cost increase rate over three time periods (every two months).
2. Multiply the initial cost by the increase factor.

Given:
- Initial cost of a bag of marbles = $20
- Increase rate every two months = 20%

The formula for calculating the final amount after a certain number of periods with constant increase rates is:
\[ \text{Final Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} \times (\text{Increase Rate})^{(\text{Number of Periods})} \]

Let's calculate it step by step:

**Step 1:**
First, determine the increase rate every two months. Since there are 36 months in total and 2 periods between them, we divide the total time into equal parts of 2 months each:

\[ \text{Total Time in Periods} = 36 \div 2 = 18 \text{ periods} \]

Next, apply the increase rate of 20% (or 0.2) to the initial cost of $20:

\[ \text{Increase Factor} = 1 + 0.2 = 1.2 \]

**Step 2:**
Multiply the initial cost by the increase factor to get the final amount:

\[ \text{Final Amount} = \$20 \times 1.2 = \$24 \]

Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost $24 after 36 months, considering the constant increase rate every two months.

"The value of the action figure is $5. Thus, the doll's price would also be $5. Since the doll's cost is equal to three action figures' costs, we can calculate the value of one action figure.

Let's denote:

- The number of action figures as \(A\)
- The number of dolls as \(D\)

Given:
- \(A = 3\) (action figures)
- \(D = 1\) (doll)
- \(D = A \times 3\) (since the doll costs as much as three action figures)

We know the doll costs $5, so:

\(5 = D = 3 \times 5\)

Thus, the value of one action figure (\(A\)) is:

\[A = \frac{5}{3} = 1.666...\]

However, since toy prices must be whole numbers, let's round up or down based on practicality. Rounding down gives us:

\[A = 1\] (action figure)

And rounding up gives us:

\[A = 2\] (action figure)

Therefore, the cost of one action figure is $5. To find the total value of all toys, we sum the values of the action figures and the doll:

Total value = Value of one action figure + Value of the doll

Value of one action figure = \$5
Value of the doll = \$5

Total value = \$5 + \$5 = \$10

All toys together are worth $10.

"If Jackie does her taxes herself, she would lose 3 * $35 = $105 in lost earnings.

The accountant charges $90, so if Jackie hires the accountant, she will still lose $105 from not doing her taxes herself.

Therefore, if she hires the accountant, she will have $90 - $105 = -$15 less money.

However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question. It's not clear what ""more money"" refers to without context. If we're considering the difference between having hired an accountant versus doing the taxes herself, Jackie would indeed end up with $105 less after hiring the accountant compared to if she had done her taxes herself. 

But if ""more money"" is referring to the amount Jackie will have after accounting for both the tax loss (lost earnings) and any potential increase due to the accountant's services, then the correct interpretation is that she will have $90 - $105 = -$15 less than if she did her taxes herself."

1. **Peeling Time**: It takes Billy 1.5 minutes (or 90 seconds) to peel each potato.
   Since there are 60 potatoes, the total time spent peeling is \(60 \times 1.5\) seconds.

2. **Cutting Time**: It takes Billy 5 seconds to cut each potato into smaller pieces.
   There are also 60 potatoes, so the total time spent cutting is \(60 \times 5\) seconds.

Now let's calculate:

**Total Peeling Time**: \(60 \times 1.5 = 90\) seconds
**Total Cutting Time**: \(60 \times 5 = 300\) seconds

Adding these together gives us the total time spent preparing the potatoes:
\[90\, \text{seconds} + 300\, \text{seconds} = 390\, \text{seconds}\]

Therefore, it will take Billy 390 seconds to finish prepping the potatoes for the barbecue. To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 seconds in a minute):

" Juan and Carlos make 1 gallon of lemonade, so for each gallon they use $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, making their total cost $3 + $2 = $5 per gallon.
They sell each glass for $0.50, and they can make 20 glasses per gallon, so they sell each gallon for 20 * $0.50 = $10.
To find out how much they spent on lemons, we divide the total cost of making the lemonade by the amount they sell per gallon. So $5 / $10 = $0.50 per gallon.
If they made a profit of $25, then the total revenue from selling lemonade must have been $25 + $0.50 per gallon * number of gallons.
Let's say they made ""n"" gallons of lemonade. Then the total revenue is n * ($0.50 per gallon) = $0.50n.
We know this equals $25, so we have the equation $0.50n = $25.
To solve for n, we divide both sides of the equation by $0.50: n = $25 / $0.50 = 50 gallons.
Now we know they made 50 gallons of lemonade.
The total cost of making the lemonade is 50 gallons * $0.50 per gallon = $25.
So they spent $25 on lemons.

Adding those two amounts together, Zaid spends 1500 + 2000 = 3500 dollars in total on rent and car fuel.

So, the remaining amount of money he has after paying for rent and car fuel is 6000 - 3500 = 2500 dollars.

He then donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity, so he donates 2500 / 2 = 1250 dollars.

After donating to the charity, the remaining amount of money he has is 2500 - 1250 = 1250 dollars.

Finally, he gives his daughter 200 dollars for her weekly expenses and 700 dollars for his wife's grocery budget. So, he gives away a total of 200 + 700 = 900 dollars.

" Let's say Jean's current age is $J$ and Mark's current age is $M$. From the problem, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write this as an equation: $J = M + 2$.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age at that time. At that time, Jean's age would have been $J - 2$, and Mark's age would have been $M - 2$. So we can write this as another equation: $M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2) + 5$.

Now let's solve these equations step by step.

First, let's simplify the second equation:

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[2M - 4 = J + 8\]

Next, substitute $J = M + 2$ into the equation:

\[2M - 4 = (M + 2) + 8\]

Simplify the right side of the equation:

\[2M - 4 = M + 10\]

Subtract $M$ from both sides of the equation:

\[M - 4 = 10\]

Add 4 to both sides of the equation:

\[M = 14\]

Now that we know Mark's age, we can find Jean's age by substituting $M = 14$ back into the first equation:

\[J = M + 2\]

\[J = 14 + 2\]

\[J = 16\]

So Jean is currently 16 years old.
The answer is: $16$"
"To determine how long it takes for each team to complete the relay, we'll calculate the time taken by each team separately.

**For the Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner runs at 55 seconds.
- Second runner runs at 52 seconds (since they're 3 seconds faster).
- Third runner runs at 51 seconds (same pace as second runner).
- Fourth runner runs at 50 seconds (also 3 seconds faster).

The total time for the well-rounded team would thus be:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 55 + 52 + 51 + 50 = 228 \text{ seconds} \]

**For the Less-Well-Rounded Team:**
- First runner runs at 60 seconds.
- Second runner runs at \(60 - 3 = 57\) seconds (3 seconds faster than the first runner).
- Third runner runs at \(57 - 3 = 54\) seconds (3 seconds faster than the second runner).
- Fourth runner runs at \(54 - 3 = 51\) seconds (3 seconds faster than the third runner).

The total time for the less-well-rounded team would thus be:

\[ \text{Total Time} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, to find out how much longer the faster team wins by, we subtract the slower team's total time from the faster team's total time:

\[ \text{Difference} = 228 - 220 = 8 \text{ seconds} \]

Therefore, the faster team wins by 8 seconds.

"To find this probability difference expressed as a percentage, we first calculate the probabilities of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 or rolling two even numbers in a row.

### Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3:

The six possible outcomes for a single roll are: 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6. 

Out of these, there are 3 outcomes where Jerry can roll a number greater than 3: 4, 5, and 6.

Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

### Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row:

If we assume that the die is fair, then the probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers (like 2, 4, or 6) is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \), because there are three pairs of even numbers (2-4, 4-6, 6-8, ...).

However, if we're considering ""two even numbers in a row,"" we don't necessarily mean the same pair. We could also have 2-4, 4-6, etc., but not 3-6, because those would overlap with the numbers from the previous roll.

In this case, the probability of rolling any specific sequence of two even numbers (like 2-4, 4-6, etc.) is \(\frac{3}{6}\), because there are 3 unique sequences of two even numbers out of the 6 possible outcomes.

### Calculating the Difference in Probabilities:

To find the difference between these two scenarios, we subtract the second scenario from the first one:

\[ \text{Difference} = (\frac{1}{2}) - \left( \frac{1}{2} \right) \times \frac{3}{6} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{3}{12} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{1}{2} - \frac{1}{4} \]

To subtract fractions, we find a common denominator, which is 4:

\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{2}{4} - \frac{1}{4} \]

\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{1}{4} \]

Now, convert this fraction into a percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \frac{1}{4} \times 100\% = 25\% \]

Thus, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 25% more likely than rolling two even numbers in a row.

"If there were 160 pieces of straw used for the rodents, and if each rodent received 6 pieces of straw, we can find the number of rodents by dividing the total number of pieces by the number of pieces per rodent.

\[ \text{Number of rodents} = \frac{\text{Total pieces for rodents}}{\text{Pieces per rodent}} = \frac{160}{6} = 26.\overline{6}\]

Since you can't have a fraction of a rodent, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or miscommunication about the distribution of the straw. Assuming the question meant to ask how many rats are in each cage (which would normally be divided equally amongst all cages), let's proceed with assuming this interpretation:

Given that there are 10 cages of hamsters and each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, we calculate the total number of pieces for the hamsters:

\[ \text{Total pieces for hamsters} = 10 \times 5 = 50 \]

To find the number of rats in each cage, we divide the total number of pieces by the total number of rats:

\[ \text{Rats per cage} = \frac{\text{Total pieces for rodents}}{\text{Total pieces for hamsters}} = \frac{26\overline{6}}{50} = \frac{26}{50} = 0.52.\overline{6}\]

Again, since you can't have a fraction of a rat, this indicates there may have been an error in the calculation. Based on our understanding, there are no fractions of rodents, so it appears there was a mix-up in the question's interpretation. Given the constraints of having exactly 160 pieces of straw, the number of rats in each cage remains undefined due to rounding issues.

However, if we assume the question intended to ask for the number of rats in each cage based on the information provided (i.e., 26 rodents and 50 pieces for hamsters), then the correct calculation would be:

\[ \text{Rats per cage} = \frac{\text{Total pieces for rodents}}{\text{Total pieces for hamsters}} = \frac{26}{50} = 0.52.\overline{6}\]

This still doesn't yield a whole number, indicating there must be another interpretation issue. Please double-check the question details to ensure they align with what was originally asked. If the intention was indeed to determine the number of rats in each cage based on the information provided, it appears there isn't enough detail or context to provide a definitive answer within the current format."
"The total amount Mandy paid back to Benedict after 3 months is $100 + ($100 * 2% * 3) = $100 + ($100 * 0.02 * 3) = $100 + ($20) = $120.

"Let's denote the number of bags bought by the trader as \(B\).

The cost to buy these bags is \(20 \times B\) dollars.

The cost to transport them is \(2 \times B\) dollars (since there are 2 bags per trip).

The total cost is therefore \(20B + 2B = 22B\) dollars.

He sells the bags at a price of $30 each, so his revenue is \(30B\) dollars.

His profit is calculated as the revenue minus the cost, so we have:

\[Profit = Revenue - Cost = 30B - (22B) = 8B\]

Given that the profit is $400, we can set up the equation:

\[8B = 400\]

Solving for \(B\), we get:

\[B = \frac{400}{8} = 50\]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
" The cost of the tickets is $20.25.

Each of the three friends paid $36 / 3 = $12 for the tickets and food.
They also went on 2 different rides which cost $33 for each ride, so the total cost of the rides is 2 * $33 = $66.
The total cost of everything is $36 + $66 = $102.

" John can collect 2 peaches a minute. Since he works for 3 hours, we first convert the hours to minutes because the rate of collection is given in peaches per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 3 hours is equal to \(3 \times 60 = 180\) minutes.

If John can collect 2 peaches per minute, then in 180 minutes, he will collect \(2 \times 180 = 360\) peaches.

"If there are ten ducks, and each duck eats 3.5 pounds of insects per week, then the total amount of insects eaten by all the ducks together in one week would be:

\[10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck} = 35 \text{ pounds}\]

To find out how much each duck eats per day, we divide this weekly consumption by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[\frac{35 \text{ pounds}}{7 \text{ days}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}\]

Therefore, each duck eats 5 pounds of insects per day.

**Note:** This calculation assumes that the daily insect consumption doesn't change based on the number of ducks or their location. However, in reality, the actual insect consumption could vary depending on factors such as diet quality, health conditions, and environmental factors specific to the area where the ducks live."

" The number of sentences Mark edits each week is 1000.

Let's denote the amount Mark gets from Publisher A as \(x\) cents per sentence. Then, the amount he gets from Publisher B is \(2x\) cents per sentence.

The total amount Mark gets from both publishers is the sum of the amounts he gets from each publisher, so it is \(1000x\).

We know that Publisher A pays him 5 cents per sentence, so we have the equation:

\[1000 \times 5 = 1000x\]

Solving this equation gives us:

\[5000 = 1000x\]

Dividing both sides by 1000 gives us:

\[x = 5\]

So, Mark gets 5 cents per sentence from Publisher A. Therefore, the amount he gets from Publisher B is:

\[2x = 2 \times 5 = 10\]

So, the total amount Mark makes in a week is:

Therefore, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week.

"Let's denote the number of cups as \(C\) and the price of each cup as \(P\). According to the problem:

\[20 \times C = 0.5 \times (P - \$1200) + 6000\]

We're also told that:

\[20 \times C = \frac{1}{2} \times 6000\]

From this second equation, we can find \(C\):

\[20C = 3000\]
\[C = 150\]

Now let's substitute \(C = 150\) into our first equation to solve for \(P\):

\[20 \times 150 = 0.5(P - \$1200) + 6000\]

\[3000 = 0.5P - \$1200 + 6000\]

\[3000 = 0.5P + \$4800\]

Subtracting \$4800 from both sides gives us:

\[0.5P = 3000 - 4800\]

\[0.5P = -1800\]

Dividing both sides by 0.5 gives us:

\[P = -\frac{1800}{0.5}\]

\[P = -3600\]

However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or an error in the calculation because prices cannot be negative. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

The correct approach would be to understand that when you multiply any number by zero, you get zero, so the subtraction operation doesn't affect the value of \(P\), leading to:

\[P = 3000 - 4800\]

\[P = -1800\]

Again, this contradicts the fact that prices can't be negative. It appears there was a mistake in the interpretation of the question or calculations. Let's correct it:

Given that the total cost of half a dozen plates (\(6000\) dollars) is paid with \(20\) cups, we know the cost of one cup (\(P\)) is \(\frac{6000}{20} = \$300\).

To calculate the total cost of buying each cup, we simply take the price per cup (\(\$300\)) and divide it by the number of cups in a dozen (which is \(12\)):

\[P = \frac{\$300}{12} = \$25\]

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool before any leak occurred as \(S\) (in gallons). Since the big pool emptied at 4 gallons/minute, it would take \(\frac{S}{4}\) minutes for the big pool to drain if there were no leaks.

Given that the big pool has four times the amount of water than the small pool after 4 minutes, we can say:

\[4 \times \left( \frac{S}{4} \right) = S\]

Simplifying this equation gives us:

\[S = 4S\]

From this, we find that the small pool originally contained \(S = 0\) gallons, because anything divided by itself equals 1.

However, given that Jerry has two pools and one leaked out at 4 gallons/minute, the small pool must have had less water when compared to the large pool, which is not possible since the large pool drains at a rate faster than the small pool can fill up. 

The information provided seems inconsistent; either there's a misunderstanding or the question might imply something else. Let me check again:

If the big pool emptied at 4 gallons/minute, and it has drained all its water in 4 minutes, then it implies that the small pool also emptied its entire volume in the same time frame. Therefore, even though the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool 4 minutes ago, by now, the small pool would have completely filled up since it emptied so quickly.

In conclusion, based on the provided information, the small pool has no water now. There isn't enough information to determine the exact amount of water in the small pool right now. The discrepancy arises from assuming the large pool emptied at 4 gallons/minute while the small pool didn't, leading to incorrect calculations.

"To find out how many melons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we first calculate how many were ready for harvest at the start.

The farm produced 120 baby watermelons.

At the end of the first month (two weeks), 30% of these were ready for harvest. So, we calculate this percentage:

\( \frac{30}{100} \times 120 = 36 \) watermelons were ready for harvest at the end of the first month.

This leaves \( 120 - 36 = 84 \) watermelons unharvested at the end of the first month.

Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining melons were ready for harvesting. So, let's calculate this:

\( \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \) watermelons were ready for harvest at the end of the second month.

Subtracting the number of melons already harvested from the remaining:

\( 84 - 63 = 21 \)

Therefore, there were 21 watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

Given that there are 20 friends and each gets 4 slices:

Now, since each pizza is cut into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas are required:

\[ \text{Pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{Slices per pizza}} = \frac{80}{8} = 10 \]

"Let's break down this problem into smaller steps:

1. **Initial Number of Students**: There were initially 1000 students in the hall.

2. **Students Leaving Through Exit A**: 30% of the students went out of the building through exit A. To find out how many students this represents, we multiply the initial number of students by 30% (or 0.30). So, \(1000 \times 0.30 = 300\) students left through exit A.

3. **Remaining Students After Exit A**: Now, subtract the number of students leaving through exit A from the initial number of students. This gives us \(1000 - 300 = 700\) students remaining.

4. **Students Leaving Through Exit B**: Next, 3/5 of the remaining students went out through exit B. To find out how many students this represents, we calculate \(3/5\) of 700. So, \(700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 420\) students left through exit B.

5. **Total Students Lefting through Exit A and B**: Add the students who left through exit A and those who left through exit B to find out how many students left through these two exits combined. This gives us \(300 + 420 = 720\) students.

6. **Number of Students Remaining**: Subtract the number of students who left through both exits from the total number of students remaining after they left through A and B. This gives us \(700 - 720 = -20\), but it doesn't make sense in the context because you can't have a negative number of students. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a mistake in the calculation.

Upon reviewing the calculations again, let's correct them:

**Correct Calculation for Total Students Lefting through Exit A and B**: 

To find out how many students left through both exits, we add the students who left through exit A and those who left through exit B together. This gives us \(300 + 420 = 720\) students.

Now, if we subtract the number of students who left through both exits from the total number of students remaining after they left through A and B, we get the number of students who left through exit C. However, when we subtract the numbers correctly, we end up with the same value, which suggests there may have been a misunderstanding in our approach or interpretation of the problem statement.

Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that the question asks for the number of students who went out through exit C, not the total number of students who left. Let's recalculate based on this understanding:

**Correct Calculation for Number of Students Who Left through Exit C**: 

To find out how many students left through exit C, we simply subtract the number of students who left through both exits from the total number of students remaining after they left through A and B. This gives us \(700 - 720 = -20\).

However, this still doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of students. We've made a mistake in our understanding of the problem. Let's go back and review the original problem statement carefully.

Upon revisiting the problem statement, we see that the question asks about the number of students who went out through exit C, not the total number of students who left. Our previous calculation for the total number of students who left through A and B was incorrect. Let's correct this:

**Correct Calculation for Number of Students Who Left through Exit C**: 

We're asked for the number of students who went out through exit C. Since we know the number of students who went through exits A and B (which is the sum of what we calculated previously), we subtract the sum of those students from the total number of students remaining after they left through A and B. This gives us \(700 - 720 = -20\).

Again, this result doesn't make sense because you can't have a negative number of students. Let's reconsider the problem once more.

Upon further review, we realize that there must have been a misunderstanding in interpreting the problem statement. The question asks for the number of students who went out through exit C, not the total number of students who left. We've made a mistake in our understanding of the problem statement.

Upon re-examining the problem statement, we understand that the question asks for the number of students who went out through exit C, not the total number of students who left. Based on the revised understanding, let's correct the calculation:

"To find out how long it takes to cook the chicken, we first calculate the additional time needed after heating the oil to 400 degrees.

The initial time to heat the oil to 300 degrees is 20 minutes.

The increase in time required to heat the oil to 400 degrees compared to 300 degrees is \(20 \times 40\% = 8\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time taken to heat the oil to 400 degrees is \(20 + 8 = 28\) minutes.

After heating the oil, it takes 5 minutes less to cook the chicken than it took to heat the oil. So, the cooking time is \(28 - 5 = 23\) minutes.

In summary, the total time spent from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken is:

\[ 90 + 180 = 270 \] stitches.

Since this is for both the collar and the rosette combined, we can subtract this from the total number of stitches to find out how many stitches are used for the body alone:
\[ 1800 - 270 = 1530 \] stitches.

We know the body takes 900 stitches, so the number of stitches used for each sleeve is:
\[ 1530 - 900 = 630 \] stitches.

Therefore, each sleeve takes 630 stitches.

"To find out how much Mrs. Rylan spent, we first calculate the cost of each type of seed separately and then sum these amounts.

For the tomato seeds:
- Each packet costs $40.
- She bought 20 packets.
- So, the total cost for tomato seeds = 20 packets * $40/packet = $800.

For the celery seeds:
- Each packet costs $30.
- She bought 80 packets.
- So, the total cost for celery seeds = 80 packets * $30/packet = $2400.

Adding both totals gives the total amount spent on all seeds:
$800 (tomato seeds) + $2400 (celery seeds) = $3200.

Therefore, Mrs. Rylan used $3200 to buy the seeds.

" First, we find out how many cards had the letter A on them. Since 2/5 of the cards had the letter A, we calculate:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \text{ cards with A} \]

Subtracting this from the total number of cards gives us the number of cards without the letter A:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \text{ cards without A} \]

Next, we find out how many cards had the letter B on them. Since 1/2 of the remaining cards had the letter B, we calculate:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \text{ cards with B} \]

Subtracting this from the remaining cards gives us the number of cards without the letter B:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \text{ cards without B} \]

Then, we find out how many cards had the letter C on them. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \text{ cards with C} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with A, B, and C from the remaining cards to find out how many cards had the letter D on them:

\[ 48 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 48 - 61 = -13 \]

However, it seems there might have been a mistake in calculating the number of cards with A, B, or C. Let's reevaluate the problem.

The total number of cards is given as 80. The number of cards with A is 2/5 of this, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]

So, the number of cards without A is:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

The number of cards with B is 1/2 of these, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

Therefore, the number of cards without A and B is:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of cards with C. Since 5/8 of the remaining cards had the letter C, we calculate:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with A, B, and C from the remaining cards to find out how many cards had the letter D on them:

\[ 48 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 48 - 61 = -13 \]

Again, there seems to be a mistake here because we cannot have a negative number of cards. Let's re-evaluate the calculations:

- The number of cards with A is indeed 2/5 of the total, not 2/5 of the remaining cards after removing those with B and C.
- We calculated incorrectly when finding the number of cards without A and B; it should be the total minus the number with A and B combined, not the total minus the number with A and B separately.

Let's correct these errors:

- The number of cards with A is 2/5 of the total, which is:

\[ \frac{2}{5} \times 80 = 32 \]
- The number of cards without A is:

\[ 80 - 32 = 48 \]

- The number of cards with B is 1/2 of these, which is:

\[ \frac{1}{2} \times 48 = 24 \]

- The number of cards without A and B is:

\[ 48 - 24 = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the number of cards with C correctly:

- The number of cards with C is 5/8 of the remaining cards, which is:

\[ \frac{5}{8} \times 24 = 15 \]

Finally, we subtract the number of cards with A, B, and C from the remaining cards to find out how many cards had the letter D on them:

\[ 48 - (32 + 24 + 15) = 48 - 61 = -13 \]

Again, there seems to be a mistake here because we cannot have a negative number of cards. Let's re-evaluate the calculations again carefully:

- The number of cards with A is indeed 2/5 of the total, but this should be applied to the remaining cards after removing those with B and C, not the total cards.
- We made a calculation error when finding the number of cards without A and B"

Simplifying the right side gives $6x+9 = 3x+27$.
Subtracting $3x$ from both sides gives $3x+9 = 27$.
Subtracting 9 from both sides gives $3x = 18$.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 6$.
So Sam is currently 6 years old.

"To find out how many sterling silver beads Katerina uses per necklace, let's first calculate the total number of topaz gemstones used and then determine how many sterling silver beads fit into that total.

Given:
- Each necklace requires 8 topaz gemstones.
- Each topaz gemstone is 1 inch long.
- Each sterling silver bead is 1/4 of an inch long.
- The total necklace length is 25 inches.

First, we calculate the total length of the topaz gemstones needed:

\[ \text{Total length of topaz stones} = 8 \times 1 \text{ inch/gemstone} = 8 \text{ inches} \]

Next, we divide this total length by the length of each sterling silver bead to find out how many of these can fit into it:

\[ \frac{\text{Total length of topaz stones}}{\text{Length of each sterling silver bead}} = \frac{8}{\left(\frac{1}{4}\right)} = 8 \times 4 = 32 \text{ sterling silver beads} \]

Therefore, Katerina uses 32 sterling silver beads per necklace.

To find the total number of stories they wrote in the first week, we add up the number of stories each person wrote: 20 (Alani) + 40 (Braylen) + 60 (Margot) = 120 stories.

In the second week, they each doubled the number of stories they had written in the first week. So, Alani wrote 20 x 2 = 40 stories in the second week.
Braylen wrote 40 x 2 = 80 stories in the second week.
And Margot wrote 60 x 2 = 120 stories in the second week.

To find the total number of stories they wrote in the second week, we add up the number of stories each person wrote: 40 (Alani) + 80 (Braylen) + 120 (Margot) = 240 stories.

The flag has a total of 76 stars, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows must be $76 - 36 = 40$.
To find the number of 5-star rows, we divide the number of stars in the 5-star rows by the number of stars in each row: $40 \div 5 = 8$.
Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To determine how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first calculate the combined weight of one truck carrying all 80 flagstones.

Given that each flagstone weighs 75 pounds:

The total weight of 80 flagstones would therefore be \(80 \times 75\) pounds.

Now, knowing that each truck can carry a maximum weight of 2000 pounds, we divide the total weight of the flagstones by this maximum weight to find out how many trucks are needed:

\(\frac{80 \times 75}{2000} = \frac{6000}{2000}\)

"First we calculate the number of points each player will get in the fourth round.

Mike starts with 21 points and gets 1 extra point. So, Mike ends up with 21 + 1 = 22 points.

" Sam sold 20 crates over the weekend, so he still needed to sell 120 - 20 = 100 crates.
He sold 15 crates on Tuesday, 12 crates on Wednesday, 18 crates on Thursday, and no information about Monday or Friday.
Let's assume he sold X crates on Monday and Y crates on Friday (since they were open).
Then we can set up two equations based on the information given:
X + Y + 15 + 12 + 18 = 100
X + Y + Z = 100
Simplifying this equation gives us:
Z = 100 - (X + Y + 15 + 12 + 18) = 100 - (X + Y + 45)
Since we don't know the value of X and Y yet, let's assume they are both positive integers.
The minimum number of crates he could have sold on Monday and Friday is 25 (if one of them is zero), because if both are negative, he wouldn't reach his target at all.
So, substituting X = 25 into the equation gives us:
Z = 100 - (25 + Y + 45) = 100 - (Y + 70)
We also know that Sam's target is 120 crates, so:
Z = 120 - (X + Y + 45) = 120 - (25 + Y + 45) = 120 - (Y + 70)
Now we substitute X = 25 into the second equation:
Z = 100 - (Y + 70) = 100 - Y - 70 = 30 - Y
And we substitute X = 25 into the third equation:
Z = 120 - (25 + Y + 45) = 120 - (Y + 70) = 50 - Y
We want to find the maximum possible difference between Z and the target, which is 100 - 120 = -20.
So we set up the inequality:
50 - Y > -20
Solving for Y gives us:
Y < 70
But since Y must be a positive integer, the maximum possible value of Y is 69.
Substituting Y = 69 into the first equation gives us:
Z = 100 - (69 + 70) = 100 - 139 = -39
So Sam was off from his target by 39 crates.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has been selling her dad's collection of 250 books for 3 years.
2. Each book sells for $20.
3. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.

Given that her sales number this year (which includes both first-year sales and current year sales) is 45, we can calculate the total earnings from selling the books over the past three years. 

First, let's determine the total number of books sold in the last two years.

Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, and there are currently 50 unsold books, it implies she sold 50 books in the most recent year because if she had sold more than 50 books in the last year, she would have fewer unsold books now. This gives us an idea of how many books she sold in the previous year.

Let \(x\) represent the number of books she sold in the most recent year. Then, \(2x\) represents the number of books she sold in the first year, and \(50 = 2x\). Solving for \(x\) gives us \(x = \frac{50}{2} = 25\) books sold in the most recent year.

Now, we know that the total number of books sold in the last two years is \(2x + 50 = 2(25) + 50 = 50 + 50 = 100\) books.

Each book sells for $20, so the total earnings from these books over the last two years is \(100 \times 20 = \$2000\).

Since she started selling these books 3 years ago, and we've accounted for the last two years, the total earnings from all three years combined are also $2000.

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $2000.

He also receives a $300 bonus each week for performing well, and since there are 4 weeks in April, his total bonus for the month would be 4 x $300 = $1200.

"If Joey loses 8 pounds in 4 weeks, then in one week he loses 8/4 = 2 pounds.

Given that Sandy needs to lose as much weight as Joey does but takes 4 weeks to do so, we can calculate how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight:

Firstly, let's find out how much weight Sandy needs to lose to match Joey's weekly loss rate of 2 pounds per week over 4 weeks. So, Sandy needs to lose 2 pounds/week * 4 weeks = 8 pounds.

Now, to figure out how long it will take Sandy to lose this 8 pounds at the same pace (2 pounds per week), we divide the total weight Sandy needs to lose by his weekly weight loss rate:

8 pounds / 2 pounds/week = 4 weeks.

Therefore, it will take Sandy 4 weeks to lose the same amount of weight that Joey loses in a single week.

2. **Extra Limb Every Five Days**: For the legs, since there are no specific instructions given for legs, let's assume the serum also adds two extra legs (one leg every five days) during these increments. So, we'll add another 5 increments of five days to our calculation:

He spends 3 * $50 = $150 on suitcases.
Let's say the cost of one business suit is $x. Then 5 * $x + $700 = Flight Ticket.
The value of the Flight Ticket is 5x + $700.
So we can express the total cost of the flight ticket as 5x + $700 = $700 + ($700 + 5x) = $1400 + 5x.

So the total amount spent on the flight ticket, the business suits, and the suitcases is $600 + $150 + ($1400 + 5x) = $1950 + 5x.

" When Cera is 46 years old, six years ago, she would have been 46 - 6 = 40 years old.
If six years ago the population of Chile was half what it is now, then six years ago, the population of Chile was 3000 / 2 = 1500 times the current population of Chile.
Let's represent the current population of Chile as P. So we can set up the equation: 1500P = 1500 * 40.
Simplifying the right side gives us: 1500P = 60000.
Dividing both sides by 1500 gives us: P = 60000 / 1500 = 40.
Therefore, the population of Chile now is still 40 times the current population of Chile.
To find the current population of Chile, we divide the current population by 40: 40 * 46 = 1840.
The population of Chile now is 1840.

" Let's denote the number of players on the defense as $D$. According to the problem, the number of players on the offense is twice the number of players on the defense, so it's $2D$. The number of players on the special teams is half the number of players on the defense, so it's $\frac{D}{2}$.

The total number of members on the team is the sum of the number of players on the defense, offense, and special teams, which is $D + 2D + \frac{D}{2} = 105$.

To solve this equation, we first combine like terms on the left side: $3D + \frac{D}{2} = 105$.

Next, multiply all terms by 2 to get rid of the fraction: $6D + D = 210$, which simplifies to $7D = 210$.

Finally, divide both sides by 7 to find the value of $D$: $D = \frac{210}{7} = 30$.

So, there are 30 players on the defense.

"Martha initially invited 2 families with 6 people each, so there were 2*6 = 12 people from those families.
She also invited 3 families with 4 people each, so there were 3*4 = 12 people from those families.
In total, Martha invited 12+12 = 24 people.
However, 8 people couldn't come because they were ill, and 1/4 of that number had other commitments. So 8*(1/4) = 2 people had both illnesses and other commitments.
Therefore, the total number of people who couldn't come is 8+2 = 10.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. The classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys.
2. There are 1/10 as many non-gendered children as there are boys.

Given that there are 30 boys, we can calculate the number of girls first. Since the classroom has 3 times as many girls as boys, the number of girls would be \(3 \times 30\).

\[ \text{Number of girls} = 3 \times 30 = 90 \]

Next, let's find out how many non-gendered children there are. Since there are 1/10 as many non-gendered children as there are boys, and there are 30 boys, the number of non-gendered children would be \(\frac{1}{10} \times 30\).

\[ \text{Number of non-gendered children} = \frac{1}{10} \times 30 = 3 \]

Now, let's add up all the children to get the total number of children in the classroom.

\[ \text{Total children} = \text{Boys} + \text{Girls} + \text{Non-gendered Children} \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 30 + 90 + 3 \]
\[ \text{Total children} = 123 \]

" Let's denote the number of people who got on the bus at the terminal as \(x\). 

At the first stop, 5 more people got on the bus, so we have \(x + 5\) people on the bus.

Then, at the second stop, 7 people got off the bus and 8 more got on the bus. So, after these changes, the number of people on the bus becomes \((x + 5) - 7 + 8 = (x + 5 + 8) - 7 = x + 13\).

We know that this number of people equals 20, so we can set up the equation:

"To find out how long it will take to fully charge the phone from 60% to 100%, we can calculate the difference between these two percentages (which represents the amount of charge needed) and divide this by the recharge rate.

First, let's convert 60% to decimal form:

\[60\% = \frac{60}{100} = 0.6\]

Next, we'll calculate the additional charge required:

\[100\% - 60\% = 40\%\]

Now, we'll determine how many times the recharge rate applies to the additional charge:

\[40\% = \frac{40}{3} = 13.\overline{3}\]

This means the additional charge requires 13 full cycles of the recharge rate plus a remainder of \(13.\overline{3}\).

Given the recharge rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we multiply 13 by 3 to get the number of full cycles:

\[13 \times 3 = 39\]

So, there are 39 full cycles required, but because we have a remainder after dividing by 3, we also consider the last cycle, making it 40 cycles.

Since the recharge rate is 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, to cover 40 cycles, we use the formula:

\[Total Time = \text{Cycles} \times 3 \text{ minutes/cycle}\]

\[Total Time = 40 \times 3 = 120 \text{ minutes}\]

Finally, we convert 120 minutes into hours:

\[120 \text{ minutes} = \frac{120}{60} = 2 \text{ hours}\]

Therefore, it will take 2 hours to fully charge the phone to 100%.

"The customer gets $1 off their next purchase for every $20 they spend. So if they spend $80, they get $1 * (80/20) = $4 off.

They started with a discount of $4 and then used their rewards from their previous trip, which were $1 for every $20 spent. They spent $43 on this trip, so they got $1 * (43/20) = $2.15 off because it's not possible to have a fraction of a reward, we'll round down to $2.

Now let's subtract all the discounts from the original cost:

$80 - $4 ($first discount) - $2.15 ($second discount) = $80 - $4 - $2.15 = $73.85

Therefore, the customer paid $73.85 on this shopping trip.

"The value of Maria's shares after one year will be \$8(1+50%) = \$12.

The value of Maria's shares after two years will be \$12(1-25%) = \$9.

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is \$9.

Thus, the answer is \(\$9\).

**Note:** This question can also be solved using the formula for compound interest:

If we let \(P\) represent the initial investment (in this case, the purchase of 8 shares at \$8 each), \(R\) represents the rate of return per period (\$50\% increase or a decrease), and \(n\) represents the number of periods, then the final amount \(A\) after \(n\) periods would be given by:

\[ A = P \left(1 + \frac{R}{100}\right)^n \]

In this case, \(P = \$8 \times 8 = \$64\), \(R = 50\%\), and \(n = 2\). Plugging these values into the formula gives:

\[ A = \$64 \left(1 + \frac{50}{100}\right)^2 = \$64 \left(1.5\right)^2 = \$64 \times 2.25 = \$144 \]

Therefore, the final value of all Maria's shares is \$144.

However, based on the provided solution, there seems to have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem statement. The correct approach to solve the problem is through understanding the concept of compound interest applied over time. 

In summary, the correct answer is \(\$144\), not \(\$9\). The original calculation was incorrect due to misinterpretation of the problem statement."

"Let's denote the number of students in the smallest group as \(x\). Since it is given that the smallest group is 10 less than each of the other two groups, we can express the sizes of the other two groups as \(x + 10\) and \(x + 20\), respectively.

Given that there are 2 groups with equal numbers of students, we have:
\[ \text{Group 1 size} + \text{Group 2 size} = 2x \]

Substituting the expressions for the group sizes gives us:
\[ (x + 10) + (x + 20) = 2x \]
\[ 2x + 30 = 2x \]
\[ 30 = 0 \] This equation is not possible; it indicates a mistake in our interpretation or setup.

Upon revisiting the problem, let's correct our understanding:

The original statement about the groups being equal suggests that if you add up the sizes of all three groups, they must sum to 2 times the number of students, which corresponds to the total population of the class. The formula for the total number of students (\(T\)) in terms of the number of groups (\(G\)) and the number of students in each group (\(S\)) is \(T = GS\).

Given that the total number of students is 200, we can set up the equation as follows:
\[ 200 = G(S_1 + S_2 + S_3) \]

Since the groups are equal in number, we can also express the sum of the sizes of the groups in terms of \(S\):
\[ S_1 + S_2 + S_3 = 3S \]

Plugging this back into the equation:
\[ 200 = G(3S) \]

To find the value of \(S\), we rearrange the equation:
\[ G = \frac{200}{3S} \]

We're told that there are 2 groups, so \(G = 2\). Plugging this into the equation:
\[ 2 = \frac{200}{3S} \]

Solving for \(S\):
\[ S = \frac{200}{2} = 100 \]

Therefore, the smallest group contains 100 students.

"Let c represent the number of cows Farmer Brown has, so there will also be 2c chickens. The total number of legs from cows is therefore 2c, while the total number of chicken legs is 2(60 - 2c). Thus, the equation for the total number of legs is:

2c (legs from cows) + 2(60 - 2c) (legs from chickens) = Total Legs.

Simplifying this gives:

2c + 120 - 4c = 120,

- She works for 20 hours at $10 per hour: \(20 \times \$10 = \$200\).

From her second job:
- She works for 15 hours at $5 per hour: \(15 \times \$5 = \$75\).

Adding these amounts together gives us the total amount Annabelle will have after working both jobs:
- Total earnings = \$200 (first job) + \$75 (second job) = \$275.

The phone costs $400, so to find out how much more money Annabelle needs to save, we subtract the total amount she will have from the cost of the phone:
- Money needed = Phone cost - Total earnings = \$400 - \$275 = \$125.

Therefore, Annabelle still needs to save $125.

"To find the height of the tallest tree, we first determine its height based on the information given:

1. The shortest tree is 6 feet high.
2. The second tree is 5 feet taller than the shortest one, so it is \(6 + 5 = 11\) feet high.
3. Together, the heights of the shortest and second trees add up to \(6 + 11 = 17\) feet.

The tallest tree is twice the sum of the heights of the other two trees, so its height is \(2 \times 17 = 34\) feet.

Therefore, the tallest tree is 34 feet tall.

" Morgan wants to spend $5 on each of her friends who plays mini golf, so she needs $5 x (number of friends) = $5 x number of friends.
She also wants to spend $5 on each friend to use the arcade tokens, so she needs $5 x (number of friends) = $5 x number of friends.
In addition, she wants to spend $10 x (number of rides) on going karts.
Adding up these amounts, Morgan needs a total of $5 x number of friends + $5 x number of friends + $10 x (number of rides).
We know that Morgan's budget is $90, so we can set up the equation: $5 x number of friends + $5 x number of friends + $10 x (number of rides) = $90.
Simplifying this equation gives us: $10 x number of rides = $90 - ($5 x number of friends + $5 x number of friends) = $90 - ($10 x number of rides)
Solving for number of rides, we find that Morgan can invite at most 12 friends because 90 - (10 x 12) = 90 - 120 = -30, which is not possible.
Therefore, Morgan can invite at most 12 friends.

" Marisa gets $5 as pocket money every day, so in 5 days she will get 5 x 5 = $25.
Each day she buys 4 lollipops at $0.25 each, so she spends 4 x 0.25 = $1 per day on lollipops.
In 5 days, she will spend 1 x 5 = $5 on lollipops.
To find out how much she puts in her piggy bank, we subtract the cost of the lollipops from the amount she gets from her parents.
So, $25 - $5 = $20.
Therefore, Marisa puts $20 in her piggy bank.
The answer is $\boxed{20}$."

"The total distance traveled by the train is 75+100+50-(75+100)=125 miles.
Thus, the round trip from the first city to the third city is 125*2=250 miles.
Therefore, the round trip from the third city to the first city is 250*2=500 miles.
In one day, the train makes 3 trips, so it travels 500+3*250=1250 miles.
To find out how many days the train goes between services, we divide the number of miles traveled by the number of miles needed for service: 1250/18000=0.0709 days.
Rounded to the nearest whole number, the train goes between services about 0 days.

"To find out how much stuffing Mark needs for his custom dog beds, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the stuffing needed for one chihuahua bed.
2. Multiply this amount by the number of chihuahua beds (4).
3. Calculate the stuffing needed for one Rottweiler bed.
4. Multiply this amount by the number of Rottweiler beds (3).
5. Add the stuffing required for both types of beds together.

Step 1: The stuffing needed for one chihuahua bed is 2 pounds.

Step 2: For 4 chihuahua beds, the total stuffing needed is \(2 \times 4 = 8\) pounds.

Step 3: The stuffing needed for one Rottweiler bed is the average of the stuffing needed for a chihuahua bed and a Rottweiler bed. Since a Rottweiler bed requires 8 pounds of stuffing and a chihuahua bed requires 2 pounds, the average would be:

\(\frac{2 + 8}{2} = \frac{10}{2} = 5\) pounds.

For 3 Rottweiler beds, the total stuffing needed is \(5 \times 3 = 15\) pounds.

Step 4: Adding the stuffing required for both types of beds gives us the total stuffing needed:

\(8 + 15 = 23\) pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 23 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

She needs to make sure that the total of all three tests is at least 42.

Let's call the score she needs on her third test $x$. So the total score of all three tests is $33 + x$.

We want this total to be at least 42, so we have the inequality $33 + x \geq 42$.

"If Sara had 8 points before scoring more, then after scoring 8 more points, Sara would have \(8 + 8 = 16\) points.

Given that Erin now has three times more points than Sara, we can calculate Erin's points before scoring 14 points by first finding out how many points Sara had initially. Since Sara had 16 points after scoring 8 more, and Erin has 3 times more points than Sara, we divide the number of points Sara had after scoring 8 more by 3:

\[ \frac{Sara\ 's\ points}{3} = \frac{16}{3} \]

To find out how many points Erin had before scoring 14, we subtract the points she has after scoring 14 from the point totals she currently has:

\[ \text{Erin's}\ 'points\ 'before\ scoring = \text{Current}\ 'points\ ' - \text{Points\ 'after\ scoring} \]

\[ \text{Erin's}\ 'points\ 'before\ scoring = \frac{16}{3} - 14 \]

\[ \text{Erin's}\ 'points\ 'before\ scoring = \frac{16 - 42}{3} \]

\[ \text{Erin's}\ 'points\ 'before\ scoring = \frac{-26}{3} \]

However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the calculation. It's not possible to have negative points or negative amounts of points. Let's reevaluate the problem based on the correct understanding:

If Erin now has three times more points than Sara, and Sara had 8 points before scoring 8 more, then before scoring 8 more, Sara must have had \(8 - 8 = 0\) points (since if she had 8 points after scoring 8 more, she would have no points before).

Therefore, Erin must have had 0 points before scoring 14 points, because after scoring 14 points, she would have 3 times more points than Sara, who originally had 0 points.

So, Erin had 0 points before scoring 14 points.

" The cost of each picture frame is $20, and each frame needs to be etched with the logo at a cost of 20% or $20 * .2 = $4 extra. So the total cost of each frame including the logo is $20+$4=$24.
If there are 44 seniors, and 2 of them will receive pins, this leaves 44-2=42 frames needing to be etched with logos.
At $24 per frame, this will cost 42*$24=$<<42*24=972>>972.
The number of officers is 1/4 of the seniors, so there are 44/4=11 officers.
Each officer will require a cord costing $12, so these will cost 11*$12=$<<11*12=132>>132.
The remaining seniors who do not need their frames etched with a logo will all get one, so we add this to our previous totals to find the total amount spent.
The cost of the frames etched with a logo is $972, the cost of the pins is $52 (for the other 42 seniors), and the cost of the cords for the officers is $132. This comes to $972+$52+$132=$<<972+52+132=1166>>1166.

" The total interest Karan has to pay over the period is calculated by multiplying the principal amount ($3,650) by the annual interest rate (10% or 0.10). So, the interest is $3,650 * 0.10 = $365.

The total amount Karan has to pay over the period is the sum of the principal amount and the interest. So, the total amount is $3,650 + $365 = $3,015.

Since this amount needs to be divided equally into five monthly payments, we divide the total amount by 5 to find the amount to be paid each month. So, each month Karan has to pay $3,015 / 5 = $603.

"To find out how far Cho hiked, we can use the formula distance = speed × time.

For Cho:
Speed = 14 km/hour
Time = 8 hours

Distance_hiked_by_Cho = Speed × Time
Distance_hiked_by_Cho = 14 km/hour × 8 hours
Distance_hiked_by_Cho = 112 km

Now, let's calculate how far Chloe hiked:
Chloe's speed = 9 km/hour
Chloe's time = 5 hours

Distance_hiked_by_Chloe = Speed × Time
Distance_hiked_by_Chloe = 9 km/hour × 5 hours
Distance_hiked_by_Chloe = 45 km

To find out how many kilometers farther Cho hiked, we subtract the distance Chloe hiked from the distance Cho hiked:

Distance_farther_Her = Distance_hiked_by_Cho - Distance_hiked_by_Chloe
Distance_farther_Her = 112 km - 45 km
Distance_farther_Her = 67 km

Next, we need to find the average of these test scores. To do this, we divide the sum of the scores by the number of scores. There are 5 test scores, so we divide 390 by 5: $\frac{390}{5} = 78$.

However, Wilson's math grade is based on the average of his 5 test scores, not his entire list of test scores. So we don't actually add the last score (74) to our calculation. Instead, we take the result from dividing the sum by 5 (which gives us 78) and multiply it by 5.

So Wilson's current math grade is $78 \times 5 = 390$. But remember, he needs to get a 80 or higher on his next test to meet his goal. Since his current math grade is 390, and he needs at least 80 points to pass, we subtract 80 from his current grade to find out what he needs to raise his grade to 80 or above: $390 - 80 = 310$.

Therefore, Wilson needs to score at least 310 on his next test to meet his goal and receive a passing grade. The answer is: $310$."

Since there are 4 zebras, we divide the total number of stripes by 4 to get the average number of stripes: 98 / 4 = 24.5.
The average number of stripes is 24.5.

" Tyson needs to make enough sandwiches for 20 people, and each sandwich requires 1 pound of meat and cheese. So he needs 20 sandwiches x 1 pound/sandwich = 20 pounds of meat and cheese.
The meat costs $7.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 20 pounds x $7.00/pound = $140 on meat.
The cheese also costs $3.00 per pound, so Tyson will spend 20 pounds x $3.00/pound = $60 on cheese.
To find the total amount of money spent on the meat and cheese, we add the cost of the meat and the cost of the cheese together, so $140 + $60 = $200.
Therefore, Tyson would spend $200 on the meat and cheese to make enough sandwiches to serve 20 people.

"To find the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has, let's first calculate the quantities based on the given information.

Given:
- There are 40 cannolis initially.
- Allan buys 60 more cannolis.
- There are twice as many corns as cannolis initially.
- Allan buys 40 fewer corns than the number of cannolis.

First, let's calculate the initial quantities:

Initial cannoli quantity = 40
Additional cannolis purchased = 60

Thus, the total cannoli quantity after purchasing additional ones = Initial cannoli quantity + Additional cannolis purchased = 40 + 60 = 100

Now, let's calculate the initial quantity of corns:
Corn quantity initially = Twice the cannoli quantity = 2 * (initial cannoli quantity) = 2 * 40 = 80

Next, we'll calculate the final quantities after buying more corns:

Final cannoli quantity = Initial cannoli quantity + Additional cannolis purchased = 100

And the final corn quantity = Corn quantity initially + More corns purchased = 80 + More corns purchased = 80 + 40 = 120

Finally, we'll add the initial and final quantities to get the total number of items:

Total items = Initial cannoli quantity + Final cannoli quantity + Initial corn quantity + Final corn quantity
Total items = 40 + 100 + 80 + 120 = 340

Therefore, the combined total of the number of corns and cannolis Allan has in his house is 340.

" In May, Carolyn hired 40 employees, and each employee was paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek. So the total payment per employee in May is $15 * 40 = $600.

For all 40 employees, the total payment in May is $600 * 40 = $24,000.

In June, the number of employees whose contracts expired is 1/4 of the total number of employees hired in May. This means there were 40 / 4 = 10 employees who had their contracts expire in June.

The remaining number of employees working in June is 40 - 10 = 30 employees.

Each of these 30 employees was also paid $15 per hour for a 40-hour workweek, so the total payment per employee in June is $15 * 40 = $600.

For all 30 employees, the total payment in June is $600 * 30 = $18,000.

To find the total amount of money the company paid to the employees in the two months, we add the payments from May and June together. That is $24,000 + $18,000 = $42,000.

" First, we need to find out what percentage of the candles are more dangerous and have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog. This is calculated by taking the percentage of candles with a defect (which is 5%) and adding it to the percentage of candles that are both more dangerous and have a defect (which is 99%). So, the total percentage of such candles is 5% + 99% = 104%.

Next, we need to find out how many of these candles there are. Since Marcy makes 50000 candles, and 104% of them are either more dangerous or have a defect that makes them smell like wet dog, we can calculate the number of candles that meet this criterion by multiplying the total number of candles by the percentage of such candles.

So, the number of candles that meet this criterion is 50000 * 104% = 52000.

Therefore, the number of candles that both smell like wet dog and explode is 52000.
The answer is: $\boxed{52000}$."

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the shortest trees as \(S\), from the average trees as \(A\), and from the tallest trees as \(T\). According to the information:

\[T = \frac{1}{2}S\]

The total number of apples Joanne gathered is \(T + S + A = 500\) apples.

Given \(T = \frac{1}{2}S\), we can substitute \(T\) in the equation:

\[\frac{1}{2}S + S + A = 500\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[\frac{3}{2}S + A = 500\]

Since Joanne also gathers apples from the average trees (which she doesn't specify but based on her sister's description, we assume it's the middle group):

\[A = T = \frac{1}{2}S\]

Substituting \(A\) into the equation gives us:

\[\frac{3}{2}S + \frac{1}{2}S = 500\]

Combining the fractions results in:

\[\frac{4}{2}S = 500\]

Simplifying further:

\[2S = 500\]

Therefore,

\[S = \frac{500}{2}\]

\[S = 250\]

Thus, Joanne gathered \(250\) apples from the shortest trees. Since she didn't gather any from the average trees, she must have gathered all her apples from the tallest trees, given her sister helped gather half as many from the shortest trees as Joanne did from the tallest trees. Therefore, Joanne gathered \(30\) apples from the average trees.

" Let's assume the number of camels is $c$ and the number of dromedaries is $d$. We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write the equation $c + d = 180$.

We also know that the total number of bumps (humps) is 304, and since camels have two humps and dromedaries have one hump, we can write the equation $2c + d = 304$.

Now we have a system of two equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
c + d = 180 \\
2c + d = 304
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve this system by subtracting the first equation from the second equation:

$(2c + d) - (c + d) = 304 - 180$

This simplifies to $c = 124$.

Substituting $c = 124$ into the first equation gives us $124 + d = 180$, so $d = 180 - 124 = 56$.

Therefore, there are 56 dromedaries.
The answer is: $56$"

"To find out how many feet Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb, we first calculate the distance between their elevations.

Oliver is at an elevation of 3,000 feet, and the comb fell from an elevation of 10,000 feet. So, the difference in elevation between them is:

\[10,000 \text{ feet} - 3,000 \text{ feet} = 7,000 \text{ feet}\]

The comb fell 4,000 feet to a ledge below where Stanley stood. Therefore, the height above the ground where the comb landed is:

\[7,000 \text{ feet} + 4,000 \text{ feet} = 11,000 \text{ feet}\]

This is the distance that Oliver must climb to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb. 

Therefore, Oliver must climb \(11,000\) feet to reach the elevation of Stanley's comb.

"To find out how many dragons Prince Bruce has slain, let's break down the information given:

"To calculate the cost of the hay, we first need to determine the distance covered by the horse.

Given that the horse runs at 32 miles per hour (mph) for 30 minutes, we convert the time into hours:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{30}{60} = 0.5 \text{ hours} \]

The speed is given in miles per hour, so to find the distance covered, we multiply the speed by the time:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 32 \times 0.5 = 16 \text{ miles} \]

Since Michael eats 1/2 a bail of hay for every mile the horse runs, the amount of hay eaten will be:

\[ \text{Hay eaten} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Distance} = \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \text{ bails of hay} \]

Each bail of hay costs $3, so the total cost of the hay is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per bail} \times \text{Number of bails} = 3 \times 8 = 24 \text{ dollars} \]

If Michael has six five-dollar bills, the total amount of money he has is:

\[ \text{Money} = 6 \times \$5 = \$30 \]

After buying the hay, the change he would receive from the six five-dollar bills is:

Therefore, Michael will have $6 in change after purchasing the hay.

To find the total value of all her jewels, we add up the values of the sapphires she kept, the sapphires she traded away, and the rubies she received: $4000 + $2400 + $2400 = $9000.

" The volume of one raised bed is calculated by multiplying its length, width, and height, so the volume of one raised bed is 2 ft x 8 ft x 2 ft = 32 cubic feet.

Bob has 10 raised beds, so the total volume of soil needed is 10 x 32 = 320 cubic feet.

Each bag of potting soil contains 2 cubic feet of soil, so Bob will need 320 / 2 = 160 bags of potting soil.

Each bag of potting soil costs $12, so the total cost of the potting soil will be 160 x $12 = $1920.
The answer is $\boxed{1920}$."
"If we assume the number of green cards is \(G\), then we know:

\[ G = R + 60\% \times R = 1.6R \]

Given that there are 15 red cards, \( R = 15 \).

Substituting \( R = 15 \) into our equation gives us:

\[ G = 1.6 \times 15 = 24 \]

Now, let's calculate the yellow cards' count. Since yellow cards are as many as the sum of red and green cards, we add the numbers together:

\[ Y = R + G = 15 + 24 = 39 \]

To find the total number of cards of all three colors combined, we add up the counts of each color:

\[ Total = R + G + Y = 15 + 24 + 39 = 78 \]

Therefore, there are 78 cards of all the mentioned colors (red, green, and yellow) combined.

"Katelyn initially saw 50 fairies. Her friend saw half as many fairies as Katelyn saw, which means her friend saw \( \frac{50}{2} = 25 \) fairies.

Together, they saw \( 50 + 25 = 75 \) fairies.

After ten minutes, 30 fairies flew away, so we subtract these from the total:

\( 75 - 30 = 45 \)

Therefore, there are 45 fairies remaining.

" The number of puppies with spots at Jennifer's house is 3, while the number of puppies with spots at Brandon's house is 4.

To find the total number of puppies with spots, we add the number of puppies with spots at both houses: $3 + 4 = 7$.

The total number of puppies is the sum of the puppies at Jennifer's house and the puppies at Brandon's house: $8 + 12 = 20$.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots by the total number of puppies and multiply by 100: $\frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\%$.

Therefore, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

" The farmer buys 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so he has a total of 2 * 1 = 2 pounds of sugar cubes.
He also buys 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so he has a total of 4 * 12 = 48 pounds of carrots.
He buys 42 bales of hay, each weighing 75 pounds, so he has a total of 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds of hay.
He buys 20 sacks of oats, each weighing 65 pounds, so he has a total of 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds of oats.
To find the total weight of all the feed, we add up the weights of each type of feed: 2 + 48 + 3150 + 1300 = 3990 pounds.
The truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so to find the number of trips needed, we divide the total weight of the feed by the capacity of the truck: 3990 / 2250 = 1.736 trips.
Since you can't make a fraction of a trip, the farmer will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

She received a 10 percent discount on her purchase, so the amount of the discount is 10% of $10, or 0.10 * $10 = $1.

After applying the discount, the final price of Kelly's apples would be $10 - $1 = $9.

To find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky, we subtract the final price of Becky from the final price of Kelly: $9 - $8 = $1.

" Frank starts with 200 shoes.

On Monday, he gets 5 pairs of shoes, so that's \(5 \times 2 = 10\) pairs, or \(10 \times 2 = 20\) shoes.

On Wednesday, he gets 15 pairs of shoes, so that's \(15 \times 2 = 30\) shoes.

On Friday, he gets 30 pairs of shoes, so that's \(30 \times 2 = 60\) shoes.

Adding all these together gives us the total number of shoes before he gets rid of any on Saturday: \(200 + 20 + 30 + 60 = 290\) shoes.

If he gets rid of 180 shoes on Saturday, we subtract this from the total to find out how many shoes he will have on Sunday: \(290 - 180 = 110\) shoes.

" Let's assume the number of students at this grade level is $x$.
Three-fourths of the students have desktop computers at home, so the number of students with desktop computers is $\frac{3}{4}x$.

Therefore, we can set up the equation $\frac{3}{4}x + 20 = x$.
To solve for $x$, we first subtract $\frac{3}{4}x$ from both sides of the equation to get $20 = \frac{1}{4}x$.

" For the first venue, there is no fixed charge based on the number of guests attending. So the cost depends on the actual number of guests attending.

The cost of the first venue is calculated as follows:

Cost = Fixed fee + (Number of guests * Cost per guest)

Let's assume Mark wants to invite X guests to the party. Then the cost of the first venue would be $200 + ($25 * X).

For the second venue, the cost includes the cost of food for each guest. So the cost of the second venue is simply the number of guests multiplied by the cost per guest.

To make the two venues' costs equal, we can set up the equation:

$200 + ($25 * X) = $25 * N

Where N represents the number of guests at the second venue.

We want to solve this equation for X, but let's simplify it first. We know that the cost of the second venue is also $200, so we can rewrite the equation as:

$25 * N = $25 * X + $200

Now we can rearrange the terms to isolate X:

X = ($25 * N - $200) / $25

If we substitute N with X in the equation, we get:

X = ($25 * X - $200) / $25

Multiplying both sides by $25 gives us:

$25 * X = $25 * X - $200

Subtracting $25 * X from both sides gives us:

$0 = -$200

This tells us that whatever value X is, it must be negative because subtracting a negative number from another negative number results in a positive result. This doesn't make sense in this context, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.

Upon closer inspection, we realize that our setup for the second venue was incorrect. The cost of the second venue should actually be the same as the first venue, considering food is already included in the cost per guest. Therefore, we should set up the equation as follows:

$200 + ($25 * N) = $25 * N

Simplifying this equation gives us:

$200 = $25 * N

Dividing both sides by $25 gives us:

N = $200 / $25

Calculating this gives us:

N = 8

Therefore, Mark needs to invite 8 guests to the party for the two venues to be equally cost-effective."

" The zoo has twice as many cows as the farm does, so it has 2 * 30 = 60 cows.
The zoo also has 20 sheep, which is half as many as the number of cows at the zoo. So there are 60 * 2 = 120 cows at the zoo.
Adding these together, the zoo has a total of 120 + 20 = 140 animals.

Similarly, the farm has 30 cows, which is half as many as the number of sheep at the zoo. So there are 20 * 2 = 40 sheep at the farm.
Adding these together, the farm has a total of 30 + 40 = 70 animals.

To find the total number of animals the farm and zoo have combined, we add the number of animals at the farm and the number of animals at the zoo: 70 + 140 = 210.
The answer is $\boxed{210}$."
"If Rose bought 12 onions and 4 potatoes, and this is four times the amount Sophia bought, then we can find the amount Sophia bought by dividing Rose's onion count by 4.

The amount Sophia bought is \( \frac{12}{4} = 3 \) onions.

Rose also bought 4 potatoes, so if we add these two quantities together, we get the total number of items Sophia bought:

\( 3 \text{ (onions)} + 4 \text{ (potatoes)} = 7 \)

Therefore, Sophia bought a total of 7 onions and potatoes combined at the market.

"First, let's calculate how many days are left until Andy's birthday.

His birthday is on January 19th, so there are \(31 - 19 = 12\) days left from now.

Now, we know that Andy needs to burn 3500 calories to lose one pound. To find out how many calories he needs to burn to lose 30 pounds:

\(3500 \times 30 = 105000\) calories

To figure out how many calories he needs to consume each day to achieve this goal, we divide the total number of calories needed by the number of days left:

\(105000 \div 12 = 8750\) calories per day

Therefore, Andy needs to consume 8750 calories less than what he burns each day to reach his goal by his birthday.

However, if we want to consider a positive calorie deficit, meaning that he needs to burn fewer calories than he consumes, we subtract the required daily calorie intake from the target total:

\(105000 - 8750 = 96250\) calories

So, Andy needs to consume 96250 calories each day to achieve a calorie deficit and still meet his weight loss goal by his birthday."

"Let l represent the cost of the land, so the house would cost 3l.

The total cost can be represented as:

l (land) + 3l (house) = $120,000

Combine like terms:

Divide both sides by 4 to solve for l:

l = $120,000 / 4 = $30,000

Now we know the cost of the land ($30,000), we can calculate the cost of the house by multiplying this amount by 3:

House cost = 3 * l = 3 * $30,000 = $90,000

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

"To determine how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make from the 27 cups of raisins, we first need to calculate the amount of raisins needed for one batch.

A batch of oatmeal cookies requires 3/4 cup of raisins. Since there are 27 cups of raisins in the jumbo bag:

\[ \text{Amount of raisins for one batch} = \frac{3}{4} \times 27 \]

\[ \text{Amount of raisins for one batch} = 27 \times \frac{3}{4} \]

\[ \text{Amount of raisins for one batch} = 18.25 \] cups (rounded down because you can't have part of a cup)

Now, we divide the total number of raisins by the amount required for one batch to find out how many batches she can make:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{\text{Total raisins}}{\text{Raisins per batch}} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = \frac{27}{18.25} \]

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 1.46 \]

Since you can't make a fraction of a batch, we round down to the nearest whole number:

\[ \text{Number of batches} = 1 \]

Therefore, Heather can make 1 batch of oatmeal cookies with the raisins she has."

"Let's denote the number of people painting a whole house as \( P \), the time it takes to paint a single house as \( T \) (in days), and the work rate (\( R \)) at which the house is painted.

Given:
- One person paints half a house in 5 days.
- The work rate of 1 person is half of a house per day, or \( \frac{1}{2} \).

The equation representing the work done by 1 person in 5 days is:
\[ R \times 5 = \frac{1}{2} \]

From this, we can solve for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{\frac{1}{2}}{5} = \frac{1}{10} \text{ houses per day} \]

Now, if there are 5 people working together, their combined work rate becomes:
\[ R_{\text{combined}} = 5 \times \frac{1}{10} = \frac{1}{2} \text{ houses per day} \]

To find out how long it takes for these 5 people to paint a whole house, we use the formula:
\[ T = \frac{W}{R_{\text{combined}}} \]
where \( W \) is the work to be done, which is painting the whole house, and \( R_{\text{combined}} \) is the combined work rate of the group.

Substituting the values we have:
\[ T = \frac{1}{\frac{1}{2}} = 2 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 2 days to paint a whole house."

He worked out:

- For 4 weeks (excluding the times when he exercised for longer than normal)

- For 1 week at 6 hours

First, let's sum up the hours from these periods:

\[4 \text{ weeks} \times 4 \text{ hours/week} + 2 \times 5 \text{ hours} + 1 \times 6 \text{ hours}\]

"To find out the total cost for both subs, we first calculate the cost of each type of sandwich separately.

For the foot-long fish sub:
Cost = Price of Fish Sub = $40

For the six-inch cold-cut combo sub:
Cost = Cost of Cold- Cut Combo/Sub = \(3 \times\) Cost of Fish Sub = \(3 \times$40 = $120\)

Now, let's add the two costs together to get the total cost:

Total Cost = Cost of Fish Sub + Cost of Cold- Cut Combo/Sub
Total Cost = $40 + $120
Total Cost = $160

Therefore, the total cost for both sandwiches is $160."

"For the first tooth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $5.00.
For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon $1.00 per tooth, so $1.00 x 3 = $3.00.
For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave Sharon half the amount of money per tooth as Sharon had received for each of the previous three teeth. Since Sharon received $1.00 for each of the previous three teeth, the tooth fairy gave her $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth for these two teeth. So for the last two teeth, Sharon received $0.50 x 2 = $1.00.
To find out how much money the tooth fairy left Sharon, we add up all the amounts: $5.00 (first tooth) + $3.00 (next three teeth) + $1.00 (last two teeth) = $9.00.

"To find out how many roses Ford lacks to supply all the flower shops every month, we'll first calculate the total number of roses needed for one month (assuming there are about 4 weeks in a month) and then subtract the roses Ford already supplies.

For one month, considering there are 4 weeks:
First shop: 20 roses per week
Second shop: 15 roses per week
Third shop: 30 roses per week
Total weekly requirement: \(20 + 15 + 30 = 65\) roses per week

For a month (4 weeks):

Now, Ford supplies 40 roses per week, so let's see how many he supplies monthly:

\(40 \text{ roses/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 160\) roses per month

Subtracting what Ford supplies from what he needs gives us the difference:

\(260 \text{ roses/month} - 160 \text{ roses/month} = 100\) roses

Therefore, Ford lacks 100 roses to supply all the flower shops every month."
" Katina starts with $3000 in her savings account.

"To find Maggie's adjusted temperature, we can use the formula:

Adjusted Temperature = Initial Temperature + (Percentage Off * Initial Temperature)

Given:
Initial Temperature = 468°F
Percentage Off = ?% (We don't know this yet, but let's call it 'x')
Adjusted Temperature = 520°F

We want to calculate the Percentage Off. Since the oven's temperature is always off by the same percentage for all recipes, we'll assume that the percentage difference between the desired temperature and the actual temperature is constant.

Let's denote the percentage off as \(x\). The equation then becomes:

\[520°F = 468°F + (x \times 468°F)\]

To solve for \(x\), first subtract 468°F from both sides:

\[520°F - 468°F = x \times 468°F\]
\[52°F = x \times 468°F\]

Now divide both sides by 468°F to solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{52°F}{468°F}\]

\[x ≈ 0.112\]

This means Maggie's oven is off by approximately 11.2% for any given recipe.

Substituting \(x\) back into our initial formula gives us:

\[Adjusted Temperature = 468°F + (0.112 \times 468°F) = 468°F + 53.2°F = 521.2°F\]

Therefore, Maggie should adjust her oven by 11.2%, setting it to about 521.2°F for her next cooking session."

The total number of jelly beans in the jar is B + 0.99B + 1.01B = 3.00B.
We know this total is equal to 4500, so we have the equation 3.00B = 4500.
Solving for B, we find B = 4500 / 3.00 = 1500.
Therefore, the number of red jelly beans is 0.99B = 0.99 * 1500 = 1485.
And the number of green jelly beans is 1.01B = 1.01 * 1500 = 1555.
To find how many more green jelly beans there are than red ones, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: 1555 - 1485 = 70.

"To determine when the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's 20-foot second-story window, we first calculate how many days it takes for the beanstalk to reach the initial 4 feet height.

Given:
- Beanstalk starts at 4 feet.
- It doubles its height every day.
- Height reaches 4 feet after \(d\) days.

The formula to find the number of days (\(d\)) it takes for the beanstalk to reach its starting point (4 feet) is:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{\text{Starting Height}}{\text{Height Doubling Rate}} \]

Plugging in the numbers:

\[ d = \frac{4}{2} = 2 \] days.

However, since we're looking for when the beanstalk is taller than Mark's 20-foot window, we need to know when this happens. Given that the beanstalk doubles its height daily, it will continue to double until it exceeds 20 feet. 

To find when the beanstalk is taller than 20 feet, we need to keep track of the height of the beanstalk compared to 20 feet. We can do this by doubling the current height until it surpasses 20 feet.

Starting with the initial height of 4 feet:

- Day 1: \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet
- Day 2: \(8 \times 2 = 16\) feet
- Day 3: \(16 \times 2 = 32\) feet

By the third day, the beanstalk is already taller than 20 feet because it doubled from 4 feet to 8 feet in one day, making it 32 feet, which is greater than 20 feet.

Therefore, it will take 3 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's 20-foot second-story window.

"To find out how old Jerry will be in 3 years, we first determine his current age.

Let's denote Jerry's current age as \(J\).

According to the problem, Jerry is currently twice as old as he was 5 years ago. This can be represented by the equation:

\[J = 2 \times (J - 5)\]

Expanding this equation gives us:

\[J = 2J - 10\]

Subtracting \(2J\) from both sides to solve for \(J\):

\[-J = -10\]

Adding \(J\) to both sides to isolate \(J\), we get:

Therefore, Jerry is currently 10 years old.

Now, to find out how old he will be in 3 years, we simply add 3 to his current age:

\[J_{future} = J + 3 = 10 + 3 = 13\]

So, Jerry will be 13 years old in 3 years.

Therefore, the smallest angle measures 30 degrees.

Since two of the angles are equal (each being 30 degrees) and they together with the third (the largest angle) make up the entire triangle, the largest angle must also measure 30 degrees because the angles in a triangle always sum up to 180 degrees.

Thus, the largest angle in the triangle is \(30\) degrees.

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. Calculate the total number of street lights across all intersections.
2. Subtract the number of street lights that are not functional (which we know is 20) from the total number calculated in step 1.

### Step 1: Total number of street lights

Given there are 6 poles on each intersection with 4 street lights on each pole, we can calculate the total number of street lights at one intersection as follows:

\[ \text{Total street lights} = \text{Number of poles} \times \text{Street lights per pole} \]
\[ \text{Total street lights per intersection} = 6 \times 4 = 24 \]

Since there are 4 intersections, the total number of street lights across all intersections is:

\[ \text{Total street lights} = \text{Total street lights per intersection} \times \text{Number of intersections} \]
\[ \text{Total street lights} = 24 \times 4 = 96 \]

### Step 2: Number of functioning street lights

If 20 streetlights are not functional, then the number of functioning street lights would be:

\[ \text{Functioning street lights} = \text{Total street lights} - \text{Not functional street lights} \]
\[ \text{Functioning street lights} = 96 - 20 = 76 \]

Therefore, there are 76 functioning street lights across all the intersections combined.

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20\ \text{kbit/s}}{8\ \text{s/mi}} \times 60\ \text{min/hr} \]

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{20}{8} \times 60 \times 60 \]

\[ \text{Speed} = 2.5 \times 60 \times 60 \]

Given:

- There are 100 surfers in total.
- Only 25% of the riders can stay upright when a wave over 30 feet arrives.
- Of these riders, 60% are women.

Let's break it down step-by-step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of riders who can stay upright
25% of 100 equals \(0.25 \times 100 = 25\) riders can stay upright.

### Step 2: Calculate the number of women among those who can stay upright
Of these 25 riders, 60% are women, so \(0.60 \times 25 = 15\) women can stay upright.

### Step 3: Subtract the number of women from the total number of riders to find the number of men
The number of men is \(100 - 15 = 85\).

Therefore, 85 men can stay upright on the wave.

The cost of a silver Jewell is $400 less than the price of gold, so its price is:

To find the total price for all three jewels, we add their individual prices together:

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to determine their relative speed between them. Since Bob is moving at 55 mph while Tom is moving at 70 mph, their relative speed is:

\[ \text{Relative Speed} = \text{Speed of Bob} - \text{Speed of Tom} = 55 - 70 = -15 \text{ mph} \]

However, this calculation doesn't make sense because speed cannot be negative. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. Let's re-evaluate the problem.

Given that Bob is currently 75 miles ahead of Tom, and they are both moving towards each other at speeds of 55 mph and 70 mph respectively (with Tom being faster), we can calculate the time it takes for Tom to catch up to Bob using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Relative Speed}} \]

In this case, the distance to cover for Tom to catch up to Bob is the initial 75 miles difference plus the total distance covered during the entire journey (which would depend on how far they travel over the years). However, since the problem asks about catching up within a specific timeframe, let's assume they both drive at the same rate for simplicity.

If we consider Tom driving at his current speed of 70 mph for a hypothetical period of time until he catches up to Bob, we can set up the equation where the sum of their distances equals the total distance between them initially:

\[ 70t = 75 + t \cdot 70 \]

Solving for \(t\):

\[ 70t - t = 75 \]
\[ 69t = 75 \]
\[ t = \frac{75}{69} \approx 1.11 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will approximately take Tom 1.11 hours to catch up to Bob. However, without knowing how far they travel in total, we can't provide a precise number of hours, but the concept remains the same that Tom will catch up in less than 2 hours assuming they move together at their respective rates.

Therefore, Tommy caught 14 fish.

"To find out how much Clyde will pay for 5 apples and 5 oranges, we first calculate the cost of one apple and one orange separately.

Given that four apples cost $5.20, we can determine the cost of one apple by dividing $5.20 by 4:

Similarly, given that three oranges cost $3.30, we can determine the cost of one orange by dividing $3.30 by 3:

\[ \text{Cost of one orange} = \frac{\$3.30}{3} = \$1.10 \]

Now that we know the cost of one apple and one orange, we can calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges:

\[ \text{Total cost for 5 apples} = 5 \times \$1.30 = \$6.50 \]
\[ \text{Total cost for 5 oranges} = 5 \times \$1.10 = \$5.50 \]

However, the store offered a 10% discount on the total cost on Wednesday. So the discount amount was 10% of $600, which is 0.10 * $600 = $60.

After applying the discount, the final cost for Wednesday was $600 - $60 = $540.

To find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days, we subtract the smaller final cost from the larger one: $540 - $398 = $142.

"If Ariadne's sales from red hats were $400 in a particular month, and this was half the total amount she earned from selling green hats, her sales from selling green hats would have been $400 * 2 = $800.

The total sales from both red and green hats in one month would therefore be $400 (red) + $800 (green) = $1200.

In the second month, her sales were 3/4 of the total sales of the first month. So, her sales in the second month would have been 3/4 * $1200 = $900.

Therefore, the total amount she made in two months would be $400 (from red hats in the first month) + $900 (from green hats in the second month) = $1300.

"To calculate how much Sally was withheld from her wage, we first need to determine her net income after receiving all her wages.

Given:
- Initial amount in the bank account: $200
- Final amount in the bank account: $420
- Weekly wage expected: $300

We can set up the equation based on the formula for net income (income - expenses) where ""expenses"" here refers to the withholding:

\[ \text{Net Income} = \text{Initial Amount} - (\text{Final Amount} - \text{Expected Wage}) \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Net Income} = 200 - (420 - 300) \]
\[ \text{Net Income} = 200 - 120 \]
\[ \text{Net Income} = 80 \]

This means Sally had an additional $80 in her bank account, but this doesn't directly tell us how much was withheld from her wage. To find out how much was withheld, we would subtract the initial deposit ($200) from her final balance ($420):

\[ \text{Withheld Amount} = \text{Final Balance} - \text{Initial Deposit} \]
\[ \text{Withheld Amount} = 420 - 200 \]
\[ \text{Withheld Amount} = 220 \]

Therefore, Sally was withheld $220 from her wage."

The total number of pages Mike aims to read is 10 pages/day * 30 days = 300 pages.

To find out how many days before the deadline Mike will finish his reading, we subtract the number of pages he still needs to read from the total number of pages he aims to read.

So, 300 pages (aimed) - 200 pages (already read) = 100 pages.

Therefore, the cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts is $5 + $5 = $10.

Similarly, the cost of a pound of almonds is $10, so the cost of 1/5 pound of almonds is (1/5) * $10 = $2.
The cost of a pound of walnuts is $15, so the cost of 1/3 pound of walnuts is (1/3) * $15 = $5.
Therefore, the cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts is $2 + $5 = $7.

To find out how much more it costs for the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we subtract the cost of the mixture with 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts from the cost of the mixture with 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

" Let's say the number of sheep on Lee's farm is $s$ and the number of geese is $g$. 

We know from the problem that the total number of animal legs is 70. Since each sheep has 4 legs and each goose has 2 legs, we can set up the equation $4s + 2g = 70$.

We also know from the problem that the total number of animal heads is 20. Since each sheep has 1 head and each goose has 1 head, we can set up the equation $s + g = 20$.

Now we have a system of two equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
4s + 2g = 70 \\
s + g = 20
\end{cases}
\]

To solve this system, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $s$ the same in both equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
4s + 2g = 70 \\
2s + 2g = 40

The total number of newspapers delivered to these two districts is \(198 + 209 = 407\).

Since James delivers 600 newspapers in all, the number of newspapers delivered to District B can be found by subtracting the total delivered to District A and C from the total delivery count.

1) Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy: \(R = K + 60\)
2) Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia: \(K = \frac{3}{4}A\)

We know that Arelia has $120, so we substitute A = 120 into the second equation to find Kassidy's amount (K):

\(K = \frac{3}{4} \times 120 = 90\)

Now we can use the first equation to find Rayna's amount (R):

\(R = K + 60 = 90 + 60 = 150\)

The sum of all their money before sharing is \(R + K + A = 150 + 90 + 120 = 360\).

To share this money equally among the three, we divide the total sum by 3:

" The growth rate of the bamboo is 30 inches a day. We want to find out when the height will be 600 inches. 

First, we need to convert the height from feet to inches because the growth rate is given in inches per day. There are 12 inches in a foot, so 20 feet is equal to $20 \times 12 = 240$ inches.

The formula to calculate the number of days it takes for the bamboo to grow from one height to another is:

$$\text{Days} = \frac{\text{Target height} - \text{Current height}}{\text{Growth rate}}$$

Substituting the values into the formula gives:

$$\text{Days} = \frac{600 - 240}{30} = \frac{360}{30} = 12$$

So, it will take 12 days for the bamboo to reach a height of 600 inches.

" First, we need to find out how many potato servings (hash browns) one potato makes. We can do this by dividing the number of potato servings (hash browns) by the number of potatoes used to get them. 

Given that 6 potatoes make 36 hash browns, we can set up the proportion:

$$\frac{6 \text{ potatoes}}{36 \text{ hash browns}} = \frac{x \text{ potatoes}}{y \text{ hash browns}}.$$

We know that $x$ equals 6 and $y$ equals 36. So we have:

$$\frac{6}{36} = \frac{x}{y}.$$

To solve for $x$, we cross multiply:

$$6y = 36x,$$
$$y = \frac{36x}{6},$$
$$y = 6x.$$

Now, we want to find out how many hash browns can be made from 96 potatoes. Since 96 potatoes equal 6 times as many hash browns as one potato, we can calculate it like this:

$$\frac{96 \text{ potatoes}}{6 \text{ potatoes/hour}} = 16 \text{ hash browns}.$$

Therefore, you can make $\boxed{16}$ hash browns out of 96 potatoes.

Combining like terms gives $10x + 21 = 44$.
Subtracting 21 from both sides gives $10x = 23$, and dividing by 10 gives $x = \frac{23}{10}$.

Area = 68 × 144
Area = 9744 square inches

To convert this back to square feet, we divide by 144:

Area = 9744 ÷ 144
Area = 68 square feet

Therefore, Brittany's quilted comforter measures 68 square feet.

"If there are 5 times as many regular chairs as high chairs, and there are 8 high chairs, then the number of regular chairs is \(8 \times 5 = 40\).

In total, there are \(42\) adults (\(40\) regular chairs plus \(22\) additional adult chairs) and \(15\) babies (\(15\) baby chairs), making it \(42 + 15 = 57\) people.

To find out how many more chairs Mia needs, we subtract the number of chairs already accounted for from the total number of people:

\(57\) (total people) minus \(40\) (regular chairs) equals \(17\).

Therefore, Mia needs \(17\) more chairs to accommodate all the guests at the function.

" First, we find the number of buck deer in the field by taking 50% of the total number of deer, which is 50 deer.

To calculate this, we multiply 50 deer by 50%, or 0.50, so we get $50 \times 0.50 = 25$ buck deer.

Next, we find the number of 8-point buck deer by taking 20% of the number of buck deer that are 8-point, which is 20% of 25 deer.

To calculate this, we multiply 25 deer by 20%, or 0.20, so we get $25 \times 0.20 = 5$ eight-point buck deer.

" This problem involves exponential growth. Let's break it down:

1. Great Grandma Jones has 3 children.

2. Each of her children has 3 children. So, if we start with 3 children, after one generation (each child having 3 children), we have \(3 \times 3 = 9\) grandchildren.

3. Then, each of these grandchildren has 3 babies. After the first generation, they become 9 grandchildren, but now each of them also has 3 babies. So, after two generations, we have \(9 \times 3 = 27\) great-grandbabies.

4. We can continue this process indefinitely. At each step, the number of great-grandbabies doubles from the previous generation.

Therefore, the number of great-grandbabies at the end would be \(27^2 = 729\).

So, Great Grandma Jones will be kissing 729 great-grandbabies at the family reunion.

" Greta saves 50% of her pay, so she saves $2400 * 0.50 = $1200 into her retirement account.
She also makes a car payment of 20% of her pay, so she pays $2400 * 0.20 = $480 towards her car.
To find out how much money she has left to spend, we first subtract the amounts she saved and paid towards her car from her total paycheck.
$2400 - $1200 - $480 = $600
So Greta has $600 left to spend after funding her retirement and paying for her car.

When Gary joins them, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.
To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total.
So, 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.

" The firefighters have already raised $2100 after 3 hours, so the rate at which they raise funds is $2100/3 = $700 per hour.

Their goal is to raise $6300 in total. To find out how many hours they still need to fundraise to reach their goal, we subtract the amount they have already raised from their goal: $6300 - $2100 = $4200.

Now, if they can raise $700 per hour, to find out how many hours it will take them to raise $4200, we divide the remaining amount by the rate at which they currently raise funds: $4200/$700 = 6 hours.

So, the firefighters need to fundraise for a total of 3 + 6 = 9 hours to reach their goal.

" First, we need to find out how many quarts of ice cream the factory can make in one hour.

For the chocolate ice cream, it takes 2 hours to make 100 quarts. So, the rate of making chocolate ice cream is $\frac{100}{2} = 50$ quarts per hour.

Similarly, for the vanilla ice cream, it takes 4 hours to make 50 quarts. So, the rate of making vanilla ice cream is $\frac{50}{4} = 12.5$ quarts per hour.

Now, we want to find out how many quarts of ice cream can be made in 48 hours. We can add up the rates of making chocolate and vanilla ice cream:

$\text{Total quarts} = (\text{Rate of chocolate}) \times (48) + (\text{Rate of vanilla}) \times (48)$

Substitute the rates we found earlier:

$\text{Total quarts} = (50) \times 48 + (12.5) \times 48$

Simplify this expression:

$\text{Total quarts} = 2400 + 600 = 3000$

So, the factory can make a total of 3000 quarts of ice cream in 48 hours.

The length of one of Topher's shoes can also be represented as \(9x + 10\).

We know from the information given that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, we convert this measurement into inches:

\[8 \text{ feet} = 8 \times 12 = 96 \text{ inches}\]

Adding the additional 4 inches gives us:

\[96 + 4 = 100 \text{ inches}\]

Setting this equal to \(9x + 10\) (which represents the length of one of Topher's shoes), we get:

\[9x + 10 = 100\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives us:

The total number of students who don't like playing baking (or music) is \(50 - 10 - 5 = 35\).

We're told the number of students who like playing music is twice the number of those who like playing basketball. Since there are 5 students who like playing basketball, the number of students who like playing music is \(2 \times 5 = 10\).

Therefore, the number of students who like playing video games is \(35 - 10 = 25\).

So, 25 students like to play video games.

"If Jeremy scared away 1/3 of the 12 birds, this means he scared away \(12 \times \frac{1}{3} = 4\) birds.

The number of birds remaining after throwing the stone is \(12 - 4 = 8\).

A few minutes later, 20 more birds joined the group, making the total number of birds \(8 + 20 = 28\) birds.

Therefore, there are now 28 birds in the backyard.

" Let's denote the number of students in one class as \(x\), and the number of girls in one class as \(y\). We know that \(y\) is 40% of the total number of students in both classes, so we can write this relationship as:

\[y = \frac{40}{100} \times 80 = 32.\]

We also know that there are a total of 80 students between the two classes, so we can set up the equation:

\[x + x = 80,\]
which simplifies to:

\[2x = 80.\]

Solving for \(x\), we get:

\[x = \frac{80}{2} = 40.\]

Therefore, there are 40 students in each class. Since each class has an equal number of students, each class must have 40 boys.

So, there are 40 boys in each class.

"Mara started with 2 slices of cake. She added 3 more slices to get a total of \(2 + 3 = 5\) slices.

She then increased this amount threefold (tripling) to get \(5 \times 3 = 15\) slices.

" Melissa has 8 dogs that need to be bathed, so she will groom 8 animals on Monday.
She has 5 cats that need their nails clipped, so she will groom 5 animals on Tuesday.
She has 3 birds that need their wings trimmed, so she will groom 3 animals on Wednesday.
And she has 12 horses that need to be brushed, so she will groom 12 animals on Thursday.
To find out how many animals she will groom each day, we add up the number of animals from each day: 8 (dogs) + 5 (cats) + 3 (birds) + 12 (horses) = 28 animals.
If she splits the grooming jobs evenly over the days, she will groom 28 animals each day of the week.

"To find out how many more groups are needed to form when there are already 12 groups and 54 students needing to be divided into them equally, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students per group:** Since there are 54 students and 12 groups, divide the total number of students by the number of groups to find the size of each group.

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

Since you can't have half a student in a group (you'd end up with one extra student), we round this down to 4 students per group because it would make sense if you had a full group.

2. **Find the number of groups required:** Now that you know each group needs 4 students, divide the total number of students by the number of students per group to find the total number of groups needed.

\[ \text{Total number of groups needed} = \frac{\text{Total students}}{\text{Number of students per group}} = \frac{54}{4} = 13.5 \]

Again, you can't have half a group, so you'll need to adjust the calculation slightly. The exact number of additional groups needed would depend on whether rounding up or down affects the result significantly. Let's assume rounding down because that would align better with the context of dividing students evenly across groups.

\[ \text{Additional groups needed} = 13 - 12 = 1 \]

Therefore, 1 more group is needed to form when there are already 12 groups and 54 students needing to be divided into them equally. This assumes that rounding down to the nearest whole number is the most practical way to proceed in this scenario."

"To find out how much each roommate will pay per year for electricity, we first calculate the monthly cost for one roommate and then multiply that by the number of roommates.

The monthly electricity bill is $100. Since there are 4 roommates, dividing this amount among them gives us:

$$\frac{\$100}{4} = \$25$$

This means each roommate pays $25 per month for electricity.

Now, to find out how much each roommate will pay per year, we multiply the monthly payment by the number of months in a year (which is 12):

$$\$25 \times 12 = \$300$$

Therefore, each roommate will pay $300 per year for electricity.

"Jeff initially had 8 dozen glasses, and since one dozen equals 12 items, he had \(8 \times 12 = 96\) glasses.

When he received the return, there were 10 broken glasses and 6 broken plates, so in total, there were \(10 + 6 = 16\) pieces that needed to be replaced or thrown away.

To find out how many glasses and plates Jeff has now, we subtract the broken items from his initial totals:

Glasses: \(96 - 10 = 86\)
Plates: \(48 - 6 = 42\)

Therefore, Jeff has \(86\) glasses and \(42\) plates now.

" Lorraine started with 30 small stickers and traded 90% of them for large buttons. This means she traded 30 * 0.9 = 27 large buttons.
She also traded 50% of her large stickers (which were originally 40) for large buttons, so she traded 40 * 0.5 = 20 large buttons.
In total, she traded 27 + 20 = 47 large buttons.

For each large button, it is worth three small buttons. So if she traded 47 large buttons, she received 47 * 3 = 141 small buttons.
Adding this to the 30 small stickers she already had, she now has 141 + 30 = 171 small buttons.

Each small button is worth one small sticker, so she got back 171 stickers from trading these buttons.
Adding this to the 40 large stickers she initially had, she now has 40 + 171 = 211 stickers.

Finally, we add the number of small buttons she now has to the number of stickers she now has: 171 + 211 = 382 buttons.

Combining like terms gives us $3x = 33$.
To solve for $x$, divide both sides of the equation by 3: $x = \frac{33}{3} = 11$.
So the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is $2x = 2(11) = 22$.
Therefore, there were 22 votes in favor of the new regulation.

Therefore, the remaining number of people is \(50 - 10 = 40\).

Next, 60% of these remaining people think horse #7 will win. So, the number of people who think horse #7 will win is:

"Let's denote the number of puppies as \(P\), and the number of Pomeranians as \(P_{pomer}\).

Given:

1) Two-thirds of Jana's puppies are Pomeranians, so we can express this as \(\frac{2}{3}P = P_{pomer}\).

2) One-third of the Pomeranians are girls, so if there are 6 Pomeranian girls, we can set up the equation \(\frac{1}{3}P_{pomer} = 6\) because one-third of all Pomeranians equals 6.

From the second point, we know that \(\frac{1}{3}P_{pomer} = 6\). To find \(P_{pomer}\), multiply both sides by 3 to get \(P_{pomer} = 18\).

Now, knowing that \(\frac{2}{3}P = P_{pomer}\), we substitute \(P_{pomer} = 18\) into our equation to solve for \(P\):

\[\frac{2}{3}P = 18\]

Multiply both sides by 3 to isolate \(P\):

\[2P = 18\]

Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \(P\):

\[P = \frac{18}{2}\]

\[P = 9\]

Therefore, Jana has 9 puppies in total.

"First, we calculate the total amount of time Tatiana spends not playing soccer.

She spends 7 hours on Saturday and 5 hours on Sunday, so in total:

Next, we subtract this from the total time available (which is 12 hours):

\[12 \text{ hours} - 12 \text{ hours} = 0\]

So, Tatiana spends no time not playing soccer.

Now, let's find out how much time she spends playing soccer. We know she spends 1/3 of the remaining time after video gaming playing soccer.

Let \(x\) represent the total time spent on soccer (including reading). Since there are no other activities taking up any time, the equation becomes:

\[x + \frac{x}{3} = 12\]

Multiplying through by 3 to clear the fraction gives us:

Combining like terms gives:

\[4x = 36\]

Dividing both sides by 4 yields:

\[x = 9\]

Thus, Tatiana spends 9 hours playing soccer over the weekend. To convert this into a percentage of her weekend, we divide by the total weekend hours (12 hours) and multiply by 100:

"Let's denote the driving speed as \(D\) (in miles per hour), the hiking speed as \(H\), and the distance from the starting point to the vacation spot as \(S\).

Given:
1. Driving speed \(D = 50 \text{ mph}\).
2. Hiking speed \(H = D/2 - 5\).
3. Total travel time = 6 hours.

We know the driving time is 1.5 hours and the hiking time is also 1.5 hours. The equation representing the total travel time can be written as:

\[1.5 + 1.5 = 6\]

However, we need to find the distance \(S\) from the problem statement where it says ""how far was their vacation spot?"" We already have the values for \(D\) and \(H\), but we don't actually use these directly in finding \(S\). Instead, we'll use the relationship between speed, distance, and time. For a constant speed, the distance traveled is equal to the speed times the time. Let's calculate the distance using the given speeds and times:

Distance (\(S\)) = Speed (\(D\)) × Time (\(T\))

First, let's express \(T\) in terms of \(D\) and \(H\):
\[T = \frac{S}{D} + \frac{S}{H}\]
Substitute \(D = 50\) and \(H = D/2 - 5\) into the equation:
\[T = \frac{S}{50} + \frac{S}{50 - 50} = \frac{S}{50} + 1\]

Now, substituting \(T = 1.5\) and solving for \(S\):

\[1.5 = \frac{S}{50} + 1\]
\[1.5 - 1 = \frac{S}{50}\]
\[0.5 = \frac{S}{50}\]
\[S = 0.5 \times 50 = 25\]

Therefore, the vacation spot is 25 miles away from the starting point."
"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumped on as \(E_A\) and the number of enemies Emma jumped on as \(E_E\). We are given:

\[E_A = E_E + 8\]

The number of points from jumping on enemies is \(10 \times (E_A - E_E)\), so we have:

\[10(E_A - E_E) = 10(E_E + 8 - E_E)\]
\[10E_A - 10E_E = 10E_E + 80 - 10E_E\]
\[10E_A = 90\]
\[E_A = 9\]

Emma collected 3 more berries than Ava, so:

\[E_E = E_A - 3\]
\[E_E = 9 - 3\]
\[E_E = 6\]

Now, let's calculate the points for jumping on enemies and collecting berries separately.

For the enemies:

- For Ava: \(10 \times (9 - 6) = 10 \times 3 = 30\)
- For Emma: \(10 \times (6 - 3) = 10 \times 3 = 30\)

Adding these together gives the total points for enemies:

Total points for enemies = \(30 + 30 = 60\)

For the berries:

- For Ava: \(5 \times (9 - 3) = 5 \times 6 = 30\)
- For Emma: \(5 \times (6 - 3) = 5 \times 3 = 15\)

Adding these together gives the total points for berries:

Total points for berries = \(30 + 15 = 45\)

Finally, let's find the difference in their scores due to finishing the level 4 seconds slower:

Extra time = 4 seconds
Points per second = 30 points
Extra points = 4 seconds * 30 points/second = 120 points

Therefore, the difference in their scores due to the extra time is:

Difference in scores = Total points for enemies - Total points for berries - Extra points
Difference in scores = 60 - 45 - 120 = -150

However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the problem statement because subtracting the extra points from the difference doesn't result in a negative value. Let's re-evaluate the situation:

If the difference in their scores is supposed to represent the amount of extra points needed to win based on the original conditions (not considering the additional time), then the correct calculation would be:

Difference in scores = Points for enemies - Points for berries - Extra points
Difference in scores = 60 - 45 - 120 = -150

It appears there was a misunderstanding in the question's interpretation regarding the scoring system and winning criteria. The difference in their scores without taking into account the extra time is indeed -150 points, meaning both players would lose by that amount if they were to continue playing under normal circumstances. However, if the goal is to determine the winner after allowing for the extra time, the correct approach would be to consider the scenario where they played under the same conditions with the additional time added to the timer, leading to a point difference of 120 points. This scenario would not involve any subtraction from the initial difference, as it would mean both players would still end up losing by the same amount if the timer was restarted exactly according to the current rules.

Given this correction, the actual difference in scores after allowing for the extra time would be 120 points, indicating that neither player can claim victory under the present conditions. Therefore, the answer remains -150 points, as stated earlier, reflecting the incorrect understanding of the scoring system and its impact on determining the winner.

"To calculate how much money Andy's car is consuming per week, we first need to determine the total number of miles he drives.

Given that the distance from his home to work is 5 miles each way and he goes to work from Monday to Friday (5 days), the total distance driven in a week is:

\[ \text{Distance} = 5 \text{ miles} \times 2 = 10 \text{ miles} \]

Next, knowing that Andy's car gets 10 MPG, we can find out how many gallons of gas he consumes with this distance:

\[ \text{Gallons} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Fuel Efficiency}} = \frac{10}{10} = 1 \text{ gallon} \]

The cost of gas is $3 per gallon, so the amount of money spent on gas in a week is:

\[ \text{Cost} = \text{Gallons} \times \text{Price per Gallon} = 1 \text{ gallon} \times \$3/\text{gallon} = \$3 \]

Therefore, Andy's car is consuming $3 worth of gas per week.

" Carrie was given ten twenties, and each twenty dollar bill is equal to $20. So, the total value of the twenties is 10 * $20 = $200.

She also had 140 quarters. Since each quarter is worth $0.25, the total value of the quarters is 140 * $0.25 = $35.

The total amount of money she had initially is the sum of the value of the twenties and the value of the quarters, which is $200 + $35 = $235.

If she spent 3/5 of the twenties, the number of twenties she spent is (3/5) * 10 = 6.

The total amount of money she spent on the twenties is 6 * $20 = $120.

To find the total amount of money she paid for the lunch, we subtract the amount she spent on the twenties from the initial amount of money she had. That is $235 - $120 = $115.

"To find out how many OLED TVs Samwell was able to sell, we first calculate the number of each type of TV based on the percentages given.

One-fourth of the sales are smart TVs, so:
\[ \frac{1}{4} \times 40 = 10 \text{ smart TVs} \]

One-eighth of the sales are analog TVs, so:
\[ \frac{1}{8} \times 40 = 5 \text{ analog TVs} \]

The total number of smart TVs and analog TVs combined is:
\[ 10 + 5 = 15 \]

Therefore, the rest of the sales must be OLED TVs. To find the number of OLED TVs sold:
\[ 40 - 15 = 25 \]

Thus, Samwell was able to sell 25 OLED TVs.

"If it was 45 degrees during the day and it's 33 degrees colder than that at night, then it would be \(45 - 33 = 12\) degrees colder.

Each log of wood heated the house up by 5 degrees, so to heat the house back up to its original temperature (which would be 45 degrees), we divide the difference between the initial temperature and the final temperature by the heating rate:

\[ \frac{12}{5} = 2.4 \]

To find out how many logs Carson needs to burn, we multiply this number by the number of times he burns a log, which is 2:

\[ 2.4 \times 2 = 4.8 \]

Therefore, Carson needs to burn 4.8 logs to prevent the pipes from freezing.

However, since he can't actually burn a fraction of a log, he'll need to round up to the nearest whole number, meaning he'll need to burn 5 logs to ensure the pipes don't freeze.

"To find out how many seashells were brought back, we first calculate the total number of groups, which is 90 divided by 9 (since each group consists of 9 people).

Total groups = 90 ÷ 9 = 10 groups.

Next, we find out how many groups brought back seashells by considering 3/5 of these groups. So, we multiply the total number of groups by 3/5:

Groups bringing back seashells = 10 × 3/5 = 6 groups.

Each of these groups brought back 2 seashells, so we multiply the number of such groups by 2:

Seashells brought back = 6 × 2 = 12 seashells.

Therefore, they brought back 12 seashells in total.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company pays to its employees after three months, we first need to determine the total monthly payment and then multiply it by 3.

The company hires 20 new employees every month, with each employee receiving a $4000 salary per month. So, the total monthly cost for salaries is:

\[20 \text{ employees} \times \$4000/\text{employee} = \$80,000\]

After one month, the company will have \(200 + 20 = 220\) employees. Therefore, the total amount of money the company pays after one month is:

\[220 \text{ employees} \times \$4000/\text{employee} = \$880,000\]

For the next two months (with another 20 employees hired), the total monthly payment would be:

\[20 \text{ employees} \times \$4000/\text{employee} = \$80,000\]

Multiplying this by 2 gives us the total amount of money the company pays over the course of these two months:

\[2 \times \$80,000 = \$160,000\]

Adding the amounts from all three months together:

\[\$880,000 (\text{first month}) + \$160,000 (\text{next two months}) = \$1,040,000\]

Therefore, the company pays a total of $1,040,000 to its employees after three months.

"Dale initially had 100 butterscotch candies and sold 150. So he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies.

However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question. It states that Dale ordered 100 more after selling 150. This implies that when he ordered 100 more, he didn't add those 100 candies to the previous count of 100. Instead, he added them to his initial stock of 100. 

Let's calculate this correctly:

He originally had 100 candies and sold 150, so he was left with 100 - 150 = -50 candies. But we can't have negative candies, so let's correct our understanding.

When Dale first calculated the number of candies left, he subtracted the number of candies sold from the original order (100). However, when he ordered more, he didn't increase the total count of candies he had. Instead, he added the additional order to the existing stock, meaning he actually increased the total count of candies.

After ordering 100 more, his total would be:

100 (original) + 100 (new order) = 200 candies.

Now, to find out how many more he needs to sell to reach his goal of selling all his 300 candies, we simply subtract the current total from his goal:

300 (goal) - 200 (current total) = 100 candies.

Therefore, Dale still needs to sell 100 more candies to meet his goal of selling all 300 candies.

" First, let's find out how many marshmallows were used for the S'mores made by John and DeSean. They both made 9 S'mores each, so together they used 9 + 9 = 18 marshmallows.

Next, we know there were originally 35 marshmallows in the bag. After using 18 for the S'mores, there were 35 - 18 = 17 marshmallows left.

Now, we want to figure out how many S'mores each kid can have with the marshmallows left in the bag. Since John and DeSean made 18 S'mores between them, and there are now 17 marshmallows left, each can have 18 / 17 = approximately 1.058 S'mores.

However, you can't have a fraction of a S'more, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number. That means each of them can have 1 S'more with the marshmallows left in the bag.

Finally, we also need to consider that John and DeSean both dropped 3 marshmallows on the ground. So, if we add those 3 to the 17 marshmallows left, there would be 17 + 3 = 20 marshmallows in the bag. This means each of them can still have 1 S'more from the 20 marshmallows they could use, but again, we can't have a fraction of a S'more, so we'll round down to the nearest whole number. That means each of them can have 1 S'more from the 20 marshmallows they could use.

"She uses the same amount of salt as she does zest, so if she uses x ounces of zest, she uses x ounces of salt. Since she uses twice as much oil as salt, she uses 2x ounces of oil.

Given that she uses the same amount of oil as she does salt (which we'll call y), we can set up the equation:

\[y = 2x\]

We know that the amount of oil used is also equal to the amount of salt used, which is \(x\) ounces. So,

\[y = x\]

From the first equation, substituting \(y = 2x\) gives us:

\[2x = x\]

Solving this equation will help us find the value of \(x\), which represents the amount of zest she uses. 

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[x = \frac{2x}{2}\]
\[x = x\]

This shows that the amount of zest (\(x\)) equals the amount of oil (\(y\)), confirming our setup and solving method correctly.

To find the amount of oil she uses, we substitute \(y = 2x\) into the equation:

\[y = 2x = 2 \times x = 2 \times \text{(amount of zest)}\]

Therefore, Tanya uses 2 ounces of oil.

\(8,000 \div 2 = 4,000\) bars.

For the third week, Boris produces three times as much as the first week, so he produces:

\(8,000 \times 3 = 24,000\) bars.

Adding up the production from all three weeks gives us:

\(8,000 + 4,000 + 24,000 = 36,000\) bars.

Therefore, Boris would produce 36,000 bars of chocolate during the fourth week.

"To calculate the total time Britany spends on TikTok in a month, we need to break down her activities into their respective times:

1. **Writing Songs:** Each video takes 4 minutes, and she makes 18 videos each week. So, the time spent on writing songs is \(18 \times 4 = 72\) minutes per week.

2. **Makeup Time:** She spends 15 minutes of makeup time six days a week. So, the weekly makeup time is \(15 \times 6 = 90\) minutes.

3. **Total Weekly Time:** Adding up all these components gives us the weekly time Britany spends on TikTok: \(72 + 90 = 162\) minutes.

4. **Monthly Time:** Since there are four weeks in a month, the monthly time spent on TikTok is \(162 \times 4 = 648\) minutes.

Therefore, Britany spends 648 minutes on TikTok in a month.

" The firm charges $129.00 for installation.
Angela has 6 mirrors and they cost $15.00 each, so the total cost for the mirrors is 6 * $15.00 = $90.00.
She also has 2 chandeliers and they cost $15.00 each, so the total cost for the chandeliers is 2 * $15.00 = $30.00.
And she has 20 pictures and they cost $15.00 each, so the total cost for the pictures is 20 * $15.00 = $300.00.
The total cost for all the items she needs installed is $90.00 + $30.00 + $300.00 = $330.00.
But Angela only needs the installation for 10 items (the 4 mirrors, 2 shelves, 1 chandelier, and 10 pictures), so the installation fee is $15.00 * 10 = $150.00.
To find the total cost, we add the installation fee to the total cost for the items: $150.00 + $330.00 = $480.00.

"The formula for calculating simple interest is I = PRT where I is the interest, P is the principal (initial investment), R is the annual interest rate, and T is the time the money is invested for.

For Brenda's investment, the annual interest rate R is three-quarters or 0.75 (since 3/4).

Firstly, calculate the interest earned over one year with the given rate:
Interest per year = Principal × Rate × Time
Interest per year = $300 × 0.75 × 1
Interest per year = $225

Now, since the interest is simple interest, we multiply this yearly interest by the number of years to find the total interest after 3 years:
Total Interest = Interest per year × Number of Years
Total Interest = $225 × 3
Total Interest = $675

Finally, add the total interest to the principal to find the final amount:
Final Amount = Principal + Total Interest
Final Amount = $300 + $675
Final Amount = $975

Therefore, after 3 years, Brenda will have $975 in total.

Now, let's figure out how many packs are needed. Each pack contains 8 glue sticks, and we need 54 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, we divide the total number of glue sticks by the number of glue sticks per pack:

Packs needed = Total glue sticks required ÷ Glue sticks per pack
= 54 ÷ 8
= 6.75

However, since you cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, Mr. Jackson will need to round up to the nearest whole number because he cannot buy a part of a pack. So, he needs to buy 7 packs.

Finally, to find out how many extra glue sticks he might have left over, we subtract the total glue sticks required from the total glue sticks available (since he buys packs):

Extra glue sticks = Total glue sticks available - Total glue sticks required
= 8 × 27 - 54
= 216 - 54
= 162

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks and would have 162 extra glue sticks left over."

   The total number of people infected after one day is \(10 + 60 = 70\).

3. On the second day, the same process happens again. Each of the 70 people who were infected the previous day infects 6 other people, so the number of new infections on the second day is \(70 \times 6 = 420\).

   The total number of people infected after two days is \(70 + 420 = 490\).

4. On the third day, the same process repeats itself. Each of the 490 people who were infected the previous day infects 6 other people, so the number of new infections on the third day is \(490 \times 6 = 2940\).

According to the problem, in 10 years, Melanie will be 18 years old. This can be written as an equation: $x + 10 = 18$.

To solve for $x$, we subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: $x = 18 - 10 = 8$. So Melanie is currently 8 years old.

The problem asks us to find in how many years her age will be thrice her present age. This means we want to find a number $y$ such that $(x + y) \times 3 = (8 + y)$.

Let's substitute $x = 8$ into this equation: $(8 + y) \times 3 = 8 + y$.

Expanding the left side gives: $24 + 3y = 8 + y$.

Subtracting $y$ from both sides gives: $24 + 2y = 8$.

Subtracting 24 from both sides gives: $2y = -16$.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives: $y = -8$.

However, age cannot be negative, so there must have been a mistake in our calculations. Let's go back and check our work.

We made a mistake when we simplified the equation $(8 + y) \times 3 = (8 + y)$. The correct way to simplify this equation is to distribute the multiplication on the left side: $24 + 3y = 8 + y$.

Then, subtract $y$ from both sides: $24 + 2y = 8$.

Finally, subtract 24 from both sides: $2y = -16$.

Dividing both sides by 2 gives: $y = -8$.

Again, age cannot be negative, so there must have been another mistake in our calculations.

Let's retrace our steps and look for the mistake.

When we set up the equation $(x + y) \times 3 = (8 + y)$, we made a mistake when we expanded the left side. We should not have multiplied the entire equation by 3. Instead, we should have distributed the multiplication on the right side: $24 + 3y = 8 + 3y$.

Now, let's solve the equation correctly: $24 + 3y = 8 + 3y$.

Subtracting $3y$ from both sides gives: $24 = 8$.

This is clearly incorrect. The correct approach is to subtract $3y$ from both sides again: $24 - 3y = 8$.

Then, subtract 8 from both sides: $16 - 3y = 0$.

Adding $3y$ to both sides gives: $16 = 3y$.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3 gives: $y = \frac{16}{3}$.

But age cannot be a fraction, so we must have made another mistake.

Let's go back and look at our work carefully.

When we set up the equation $(x + y) \times 3 = (8 + y)$, we made a mistake when we simplified the equation. We should not have multiplied the entire equation by 3. Instead, we should have distributed the multiplication on the right side: $24 + 3y = 8 + 3y$.

Now, let's solve the equation correctly: $24 + 3y = 8 + 3y$.

Subtracting $3y$ from both sides gives: $24 = 8$.

This is clearly incorrect. The correct approach is to subtract $3y$ from both sides again: $24 - 3y = 8$.

Then, subtract 8 from both sides: $16 - 3y = 0$.

Adding $3y$ to both sides gives: $16 = 3y$.

Finally, dividing both sides by 3 gives: $y = \frac{16}{3}$.

But age cannot be a fraction, so we must have made another mistake.

Let's go back and look at our work carefully.

Subtracting $3y$ from both sides gives: $24 = 8$.

" The total time Elaina spends performing during her final concert is the sum of the length of the concert plus the duration of the encore. We know that the total time is 65 minutes and the encore lasts for 15 minutes.

Let's denote the length of Elaina's usual concert as \(x\) minutes. According to the problem, her final concert is twice as long as her usual ones, so we can express the length of her final concert as \(2x\) minutes. Adding the 15-minute encore, the total time spent is \(2x + 15\).

We're given that this total time equals 65 minutes, so we can set up the equation:

\[2x + 15 = 65\]

To solve for \(x\), we first subtract 15 from both sides of the equation:

\[2x = 65 - 15\]
\[2x = 50\]

Then, divide both sides by 2 to find \(x\):

\[x = \frac{50}{2}\]
\[x = 25\]

Therefore, Elaina's usual concerts run for 25 minutes.

"Argo originally had 200 toys.

He gives away:
- 40 toys to Alyssa
- 80 toys to Bonnie
- 30 toys to Nicky

To find out how many toys he has left after giving them away, we add up the number of toys given away:

"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Total Microphones**: The singer has 50 microphones.

2. **Microphones That Won't Find Space**: According to the information provided, 20% of these microphones will not find any space to fit in when arranged in pairs. To calculate the number of microphones that won't find space, we can use the formula:

\[ \text{Number of microphones that won't find space} = 50 \times 20\% = 50 \times 0.2 = 10 \]

Subtracting this from the total gives us the number of microphones that will have room to fit in pairs:

\[ 50 - 10 = 40 \]

Now, we know there are 40 microphones available to form pairs. Since the singer wants to arrange them in pairs, we divide the number of microphones available by 2 to find out how many pairs can be made:

\[ \text{Pairs of microphones} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \]

Therefore, the singer was able to arrange 20 pairs of microphones on the stage.

" Let's denote Duncan's current age as \(D\) and Adam's current age as \(A\).

From the problem, we know that Duncan's current age is 60, so \(D = 60\).

It also tells us that eight years ago, Duncan was \(D - 8 = 60 - 8 = 52\) years old.

Similarly, it says that eight years ago, Adam's age was \(A - 4\), because eight years have passed from when Adam was \(A\). So, \(A - 4 = \frac{D}{2} = \frac{52}{2} = 26\).

To find Adam's current age, we add the difference between his age eight years ago and his current age (which is 26) to his current age:

\(A = A - 4 + 26 = 26\).

So, Adam is currently 26 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we simply add 8 to his current age:

\[-J = 100 - P\]

Now, let's substitute the value of \(P\) from equation 3 into equation 1:
\[P + (\Delta P + 10) + J = 100\]
\[P + \Delta P + J + 10 = 100\]
\[P + \Delta P + J = 90\]

Substituting the expression for \(J\) from the last equation:
\[P + \Delta P + 90 = 90\]
\[P + \Delta P = 0\]

Since we know that \(P\) must be positive (it represents the age of someone), and we've already determined that \(P + \Delta P = 0\), it implies that \(\Delta P = 0\). Therefore, there's no negative difference between their ages, meaning they are all adults at the same time.

To find the exact ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean, we can use the information given about Paul being 10 years older than Jean. However, without additional information, we cannot determine the precise ages. We would need to know either Paul's or Jean's exact age to proceed further.

Assuming we were looking for the average age instead of specific individual ages:
\[Average\ Age = \frac{Total\ Age}{Number\ of\ People}\]
\[Average\ Age = \frac{100}{3} = \approx 33.\bar{3}\] years.

If we were interested in finding the exact ages, we'd need to look at the relationships provided in the question. Without those details, we can't definitively state their ages. If you meant to ask for the average age, we calculated correctly based on the information given."
" Maria initially gave each of her 4 friends 2 water balloons, so she gave away 4 x 2 = 8 water balloons.
She also kept 1 water balloon for herself.
So in total, before her mom gave her any more balloons, Maria had 8 (from her friends) + 1 (for herself) = 9 water balloons.
Her mom then gave each person 3 more balloons, and since there were now 5 people (including Maria), she gave out 5 x 3 = 15 additional balloons.
Adding these to the 9 balloons Maria already had, she now has 9 + 15 = 24 water balloons.
The girls have a total of 24 water balloons.

" First, let's find out how many boxes of stuff there are in total. There are 10 people donating 5 boxes each, so that's $10 \times 5 = 50$ boxes from the donations. There are also 10 boxes already owned, so in total there are $50 + 10 = 60$ boxes.

Each table can fit 2 boxes, so to find out how many tables they need, we divide the total number of boxes by the number of boxes per table. That's $60 \div 2 = 30$ tables needed.

They already own 15 tables, so to find out how many new tables they need, we subtract the number of tables they already own from the total number of tables needed. That's $30 - 15 = 15$.

So, they need 15 new tables.

"To find the average total distance spat, we first calculate the total distance spit by both contestants.

For Zoey:
She has 40 seeds with each spatting them at 10 feet:

\[ \text{Total distance spat by Zoey} = 40 \times 10 = 400 \text{ feet} \]

For Sydney:
She also has 35 seeds but spits them at 12 feet each:

\[ \text{Total distance spat by Sydney} = 35 \times 12 = 420 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we add the totals from both contestants:

\[ \text{Total distance spat} = 400 + 420 = 820 \text{ feet} \]

Finally, to find the average total distance spat over all rounds, divide this total by the number of rounds (which is 2):

\[ \text{Average total distance spat} = \frac{820}{2} = 410 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the average total distance spat by both contestants is 410 feet.

"First, let's calculate how many widgets can be made by both machines in one day.

The Widgeteer 3000 makes 60 widgets per hour, so in one day (24 hours), it makes \(60 \times 24 = 1440\) widgets.

The WidgetMaster 9000 makes 45 widgets per hour, so in one day, it makes \(45 \times 24 = 1080\) widgets.

Next, we compare the daily production rates:

- Widgeteer 3000: 1440 widgets/day
- WidgetMaster 9000: 1080 widgets/day

To find the difference in daily production, we subtract the smaller number from the larger one:

\(1440 - 1080 = 360\) widgets/day difference.

Now, we want to know how much more money Fern would make in a month from the Widgeteer 3000 compared to the WidgetMaster 9000 over a period of 30 days:

- Widgeteer 3000 produces 360 widgets/day, so in 30 days, it produces \(360 \times 30 = 10800\) widgets.
- WidgetMaster 9000 produces 1080 widgets/day, so in 30 days, it produces \(1080 \times 30 = 32400\) widgets.

The difference in widgets produced over the month:

\(32400 - 10800 = 21600\) widgets.

Given that each widget sells for $6, the additional revenue Fern could make by choosing the Widgeteer 3000 over the WidgetMaster 9000 is:

\(21600 \times $6 = $129600\).

Therefore, Fern would make $129600 more from the Widgeteer 3000 over a month when running for 24 hours a day for 30 days.

"If Cameron stays for 12 hours, it will cost him 1000 pesos. 

For every additional hour beyond 12 hours (which is 12+70=190 pesos), the hotel adds 70 pesos.

Cameron stays for 24 hours, so the additional cost for extra hours is 24-12 = 12 hours. 

The cost for these 12 hours would be 12*70 = 840 pesos.

Adding this to the initial 1000 pesos, the total cost for Cameron would be 1000+840 = 1840 pesos.

If Cameron had stayed for 24 hours without adding any extra hours, the cost would have been 1600 pesos.

Therefore, the amount of money Cameron saves is 1840-1600 = 240 pesos.

"To find out the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after ten rounds, let's first understand what happens during one round:

1. **Each round**: Craig spells out 20 words with 15 letters each.

   So, the total number of letters Craig uses in one round is \(20 \times 15\).

2. **After ten rounds**: Since there are ten rounds, the total number of letters used by Craig over ten rounds is \(20 \times 15 \times 10\).

Now, let's calculate this value.

**Total letters used by Craig over ten rounds:** 
\[20 \times 15 \times 10 = 3000\]

Given that Craig's brother spells words with 50 more letters than Craig, we add 50 to the total letters used by Craig in ten rounds:

\[3000 + 50 = 3050\]

Therefore, the total number of letters in the words they've spelled after ten rounds is 3050."

" Let's say Dinar scored \(x\) points. According to the problem, Bahati scored 20 more than Dinar, so Bahati scored \(x + 20\) points. It also says that Bahati scored 10 more points than Dinar, so we can set up the equation \(x + 20 = x + 10\). Solving this equation gives us \(20 = 10\), which is not possible because it would mean that Dinar didn't actually score any points.

However, if we look at the information given, we see that Azibo scored the same number of points as Bahati (since they both scored 20 more than Dinar). So, let's assume Azibo scored \(x\) points. Then, Bahati scored \(x + 20\) points, and Dinar scored \(x - 20\) points.

The sum of the scores of all three is 45, so we have the equation \(x + (x + 20) + (x - 20) = 45\).

Simplifying the left side gives \(3x = 45\), so dividing both sides by 3 gives \(x = 15\).

Therefore, Azibo scored 15 points.

"To find out how many minutes Kim slept on her bed that day, we first calculate the duration of her sleepwalking.

She started sleepwalking from 2:15 AM and ended at 2:38 AM. This means she was awake for 38 minutes (from 2:38 AM to 10 AM) and asleep for 23 minutes (from 10 AM to 2:15 AM).

However, it's given that she woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to use the bathroom. Since she normally wakes up at 6 AM, she actually woke up at 5:55 AM (6 AM minus 5 minutes). So, if she normally wakes up at 6 AM, she would have woken up at 5:55 AM.

Therefore, the time she spent actually sleeping on her bed that day is:

- Time spent awake before going to sleep: 23 minutes
- Time she went to the bathroom: 5 minutes
- Total time she actually slept on her bed: 23 + 5 = <<23+5=28>>28 minutes

Thus, Kim slept 28 minutes on her bed that day.

By the third day, they had filled in two holes, so we subtract those from their total:

On the fourth day, they found a treasure chest, indicating that there must have been one additional hole dug beyond what they initially planned, because after finding the treasure, the total number of holes increased significantly. Let's denote this additional hole as \(H\).

Before finding the treasure, they had already dug \(23 + H\) holes.

The problem states that by the end of the fourth day, the island had four times as many holes as it did at the end of the first day. Since they started with 23 holes on the first day, four times that amount would be \(4 \times 23 = 92\) holes.

Given that the additional hole found on the fourth day increased the total count by \(H\), we can set up the equation:

The total number of Pokemon caught by all three is the sum of the number of Pokemon caught by each person, so we have the equation $x + (4x - 13) + (4x - 8) = 339$.
Combining like terms gives $x + 4x - 13 + 4x - 8 = 339$, which simplifies to $9x - 21 = 339$.
Adding 21 to both sides gives $9x = 360$.

" Let's denote the number of states in the USA as \(U\). According to the problem, India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, so we can represent this relationship as:

\[ \text{Number of states in India} = \frac{U}{2} + 4 \]

We also know that the number of states in India is equal to the number of states in the USA plus 4, so we can set up the equation:

\[ U + 4 = \text{Number of states in India} \]

Substituting the expression for the number of states in India from the first equation into the second equation gives us:

\[ U + 4 = \left(\frac{U}{2} + 4\right) \]

Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction gives:

\[ 2U + 8 = U + 8 \]

Solving for \(U\) gives:

\[ 2U - U = 8 - 8 \]
\[ U = 0 \]

So there are 0 states in the USA. Since India has 4 more than half the number of states in the USA, India must have 0 states, which doesn't make sense. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the interpretation of the scenario.

"Let's denote the number of cherries that Richard has as \(R\). According to the problem, Robert has 10 more cherries than Richard, so we can express this relationship with the equation:

\[R + 10 = R\]

Solving for \(R\) gives us:

\[10 = 0\]

This equation doesn't make sense because it implies there are no cherries at all, which contradicts the given information. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or the setup of the problem.

Given that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, let's assume \(R\) represents the number of cherries Richard has. Then, according to the problem, Robert has:

\[30 \text{ cherries} + 10 = 40 \text{ cherries}\]

Therefore, if we interpret the question correctly, we would find that Robert has 40 cherries, not 30. Let's correct this and solve again:

If \(R\) (the number of cherries Richard has) is represented by \(R\), and we know that Robert has 30 cherries and has 10 more than Richard, then:

\[30 + 10 = 40\]

Thus, Robert has 40 cherries, and Jerry also has 40 cherries (since they are sharing equally). The question asks how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Given that both have 40 cherries, there are **no** more cherries that Robert has over Jerry; they both have exactly 40.

The correct interpretation of the problem statement appears to be incorrect, leading to a misinterpretation of the relationships between their numbers of cherries. If we follow the original interpretation, the problem makes no sense because it leads to a contradiction in terms like ""10 more than Richard"" when Richard already has 0 cherries.

Let's rephrase the question based on the corrected understanding:

Richard has 0 cherries, and Jerry also has 0 cherries. Together, they have 60 cherries. If they want to split these evenly among themselves, each person gets 60/2 = 30 cherries. 

Jerry now has 30 cherries, but we're asked about how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry. Since they both started with 0 cherries and ended up with 30 each, there are **no** more cherries that Robert has over Jerry; they both have exactly 30.

However, if you meant to ask about how many more cherries Jerry has compared to Richard after they've both shared 30 cherries, then:

- Jerry originally had 0 cherries,
- After sharing, Jerry ends up with 30 cherries,
- Therefore, Jerry has 30 - 0 = 30 more cherries than Richard.

In summary, despite the corrected interpretation of the problem, there is still no difference in the amount of cherries between them after sharing. The original interpretation led to a paradoxical scenario where the initial zero cherry count made the subsequent addition meaningless.

To clarify, the revised interpretation should be:

- Both initially have 0 cherries,
- They decide to split the remaining 60 cherries evenly among themselves,
- Each person ends up with 30 cherries,
- Thus, Jerry has 30 - 0 = 30 more cherries than Richard.

But since we were discussing whether there are any more cherries that Robert has over Jerry, the clarification provided shows that there are **no** more cherries that Robert has over Jerry. This situation arises from the initial misunderstanding regarding the relationship between the number of cherries each person has before and after sharing.

"On Sunday, Sunny sold 10 + 5 = 15 boxes of gingerbread.
He also sold 15 - 4 = 11 boxes of apple pie.
Thus, his earnings from gingerbread on Sunday were $6 x 15 = $90.
His earnings from apple pie on Sunday were $15 x 11 = $165.

Therefore, his total earnings on Sunday were $165 + $90 = $255.

Hence, his total earnings on Saturday and Sunday were $255 + $255 = $510.

" Let's denote Emil's current age as \(E\) and his father's age as \(F\). According to the problem, we have two equations:

1) When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so we can write this equation as \(F = 2 \times (24 - E)\).
2) When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so we can write this equation as \(E = 2 \times (24 - F)\).

We also know that Emil is currently 19 years old, so we can substitute \(E = 19\) into the first equation to get \(F = 2 \times (24 - 19) = 2 \times 5 = 10\).

Substituting \(F = 10\) into the second equation gives us \(19 = 2 \times (24 - 10) = 2 \times 14 = 28\), which doesn't match our previous calculation.

Let's go back and check our work. We made a mistake in our calculations. The correct way to solve this problem is to set up two separate equations based on the information given:

1) When Emil is 24, he will be half the age of his dad, so \(F = 24\).
2) When Emil is 24, he will be twice as old as his brother, so \(E = 24\).

From these equations, we can find the values of \(F\) and \(E\):

\(F = 24\)
\(E = 24\)

Now, let's calculate the sum of their ages:

\(F + E = 24 + 24 = 48\)

The sum of the ages of Emil's dad and his brother now is 48.

"To find out how many students are leaving early, we first calculate the number of students who are football players, then subtract this from the total number of students in the class.

The total number of students in the class is 30.

20% of the class are football players, so:

Number of football players = 20/100 * 30 = 6

This leaves us with:

Total remaining students = 30 - 6 = 24

Out of these remaining students, 25% are either cheerleaders or part of the band. 

So, the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band (or both) is:

25% of 24 = 25/100 * 24 = 6

Subtracting the number of students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band from the remaining students gives us the number of students leaving early:

Students leaving early = Total remaining students - Students who are either cheerleaders or part of the band = 24 - 6 = 18

Therefore, 18 students are leaving early to travel to an away game.

To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the first time, we subtract the number of years between when his dad saw it the second time and when he saw it the first time from his dad's age at that time. That would be \(90 - 75 = 15\) years.

"Let's denote the total number of flights taken by both planes combined as \(F\). 

From the information given:

1. The first plane takes 3/4 of its flights to Greece. This leaves \(1/4\) of its flights for France or Germany. Since it takes 44 flights to Poland, let's calculate the number of flights to France from the first plane.

The number of flights to France from the first plane is \(1/4 \times F\).

However, we also know that the second plane takes 44 flights to Poland. Given that these 44 flights represent half the number of flights the first plane takes, we can set up the equation:

\[44 = \frac{1}{2} \times (1/4 \times F)\]

Solving this equation gives us:

\[44 = \frac{1}{8} \times F\]
\[F = 44 \times 8\]
\[F = 352\]

Now, knowing that the first plane takes 3/4 of its flights to Greece, we find the number of flights to France:

\[3/4 \times 352 = 279\]

Therefore, the first plane takes 279 flights to France in one day.

" Tobi's howling lasts for 20 seconds.

Chiko's howling lasts twice as long as Tobi's, so it lasts for 20 * 2 = 40 seconds.

Iggy's howling lasts as long as both Tobi and Chiko's, so it lasts for 20 + 40 = 60 seconds.

The combined length of time all their howling lasts is 20 (Tobi) + 40 (Chiko) + 60 (Iggy) = 120 seconds.

To convert this into minutes, we divide by 60 because there are 60 seconds in a minute. So 120 seconds / 60 = 2 minutes.

" The average age of the four children is the sum of their ages divided by the number of children.

The sum of their ages is $3 + 4 + H + A$, where $H$ is Helene's age and $A$ is Akbar's age. We know that $H = 2 \times (\text{average age})$ and $A = 3$. So we can substitute these values into the equation:

$$3 + 4 + 2 \times \text{average age} + 3 = 3 + 4 + 2 \times \text{average age} + 3.$$

Simplifying this gives us:

$$9 + 2 \times \text{average age} = 10,$$

so $\text{average age} = 10 - 9 = 1$.

Therefore, Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group, so Helene is $2 \times 1 = 2$ years old.

Now we know that the total age of the children is 20, and we've already accounted for Akbar's and Alessandro's ages, so we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of their ages from the total age:

$$\text{total age} - (3 + 4) = 20 - (3 + 4) = 13.$$

Finally, we can find Wilfred's age by dividing the remaining total age by 3:

$$\frac{\text{total age}}{3} = \frac{13}{3} = 4.\overline{3}.$$
But we want a whole number, so we must have made a mistake somewhere. Let's go back and check our work.

We found that the average age of the group is 1, but this doesn't make sense because the total age of the children is given as 20. 

Let's try again. We know that the sum of their ages is 20, and we've already accounted for Akbar's and Alessandro's ages. So we can find Helene's age by setting up an equation based on the information that Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group:

$$H = 2 \times \text{average age}.$$

Substituting the value of the average age (which we calculated above to be 1), we get:

$$H = 2 \times 1 = 2.$$

So Helene is 2 years old. Now let's re-calculate the total age using this information:

$$3 + 4 + 2 + H = 3 + 4 + 2 + 2 = 11.$$

Now we can find Wilfred's age by subtracting the sum of his and Helene's ages from the total age:

$$\text{total age} - (3 + 2) = 11 - (3 + 2) = 6.$$

Finally, we can find Wilfred's age by dividing the remaining total age by 2:

$$\frac{\text{total age}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3.$$

So Wilfred is 3 years old.

Each person in the church next door gets 15 cookies. To find out how many people there are in the church next door, we divide the number of cookies given away by the number of cookies each person gets:

\(750 \div 15 = 50\).

Therefore, there are 50 people in the church next door.

" The total number of slices needed is the sum of the slices for the adults and the kids.
The number of slices for the kids is 4 kids x 1 slice/kid = 4 slices.

The total number of slices for the adults is 2 adults x 2 slices/adult = 4 slices.
The total number of slices is 4 slices + 4 slices = 8 slices.
To find the percentage of the watermelon that each adult gets, we divide the number of slices for the adults by the total number of slices and multiply by 100.

"To find the latest time Jordan can start making the cake, let's break down the process:

1. **Cake Baking Time**: 30 minutes.

2. **Cooling Time**: 2 hours = 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

3. **Frosting Time**: An additional 10 minutes.

Adding up all these times gives us the total preparation time:

Total time = 30 (baking) + 120 (cooling) + 10 (frosting)
Total time = 160 minutes

Given that Jordan plans to make the cake all on the same day and it takes her 20 minutes to make the cake batter, we subtract this from the total time to find the maximum starting time:

Maximum starting time = Total time - Cake Making Time
Maximum starting time = 160 - 20
Maximum starting time = 140 minutes

Converting the maximum starting time into hours and minutes, since there are 60 minutes in an hour:

Maximum starting time in hours = 140 / 60 ≈ 2.33 hours

Since the question asks for the latest time of day, we need to convert this back to a standard 24-hour clock format. A 2-hour period before 5:00 PM is from 3:00 PM to 5:00 PM.

Therefore, the latest time Jordan can start making the cake to be ready to serve it at 5:00 PM is 3:00 PM.

Lisa sold three and a half boxes of chocolate bars, so she sold $3.5x$ chocolate bars.
Peter sold four and a half boxes of chocolate bars, so he sold $4.5x$ chocolate bars.

Together, they sold 64 chocolate bars, so we can set up the equation $3.5x + 4.5x = 64$.

Combining like terms gives $8x = 64$.

To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 8, giving us $x = \frac{64}{8} = 8$. So, there are 8 chocolate bars in one box.

" The cost to rent the studio is $25 per session, and there are 3 sessions per day. So the daily cost to rent the studio is $25 x 3 = $75.

The cost to rent the studio for 10 students is $25 x 10 = $250.

Each student pays $1.50 per session, and there are 10 students. So the weekly cost to rent the studio and each student is $250 + ($1.50 x 10) = $250 + $15 = $265.

There are about 4 weeks in a month, so the monthly cost to rent the studio and each student is $265 x 4 = $1060.

Therefore, the expected earnings of the dance studio in a month is $1060 - $75 (renting the studio) = $985.

"Let's denote the number of chocolate bars in each box as \(x\). 

For Peter, we know he has 4 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars he has is \(4x\).

For Martha, we know she has 7 boxes, so the total number of chocolate bars she has is \(7x\).

Given that Peter and Martha together have 64 and 56 chocolate bars, respectively:

\[4x + 7x = 64 + 56\]

\[11x = 120\]

\[x = \frac{120}{11}\]

\[x = 10.90909...\]

So, the number of chocolate bars in each box is approximately 10.91.

To find out how many more chocolate bars Peter has in each box compared to Martha, subtract Martha's box size from Peter's:

\[4x - 7x = -(3x)\]

Substitute \(x\) back into this expression:

\[-(3 \times 10.90909...) = -32.72727...\]

Therefore, Peter has approximately 32.73 fewer chocolate bars in each box than Martha.

Since we're dealing with whole numbers, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or an error in the calculation because the result doesn't align with the options provided. The correct approach would be to use the exact values obtained from the equation, but given the context of rounding and precision, let's round down the result to the nearest whole number to ensure the question makes sense within the context of the problem statement.

The closest integer value to \(-(3 \times 10.90909...)\) when rounded down is 32.

However, considering the context of the original problem, if we were to consider the precision and potential impact on practical applications (e.g., rounding to the nearest whole number), the most accurate way to interpret this question would involve keeping the exact decimal value and explaining why it rounds down to 32 rather than directly interpreting it as a whole number without further explanation. This avoids any confusion about rounding and emphasizes the importance of understanding the precise calculation and its implications.

In summary, based on the context and precision needed for practical applications, the most accurate interpretation is that Peter has exactly 32 fewer chocolate bars in each box than Martha."
"To find the number of female porcupines, we calculate 3/5 of the total population. The total population is 50, so:

Babies born each month = 4
Months = 12

Total babies born in a year = 4 * 12 = 48

Adding the initial number of female porcupines to the babies born, we get:

Next, we multiply this volume by 5.9 to find out how many gallons of water are needed:

Gallons Needed = Volume × 5.9 = 1400 cubic feet × 5.9 = 8260 gallons

Finally, we multiply the gallons needed by the cost per gallon ($0.10):

"To find the number of female students in Brook Hills High School:

Firstly, calculate the number of students who are over 16 years old.

Half of the students are over 16 years old, so there are \( \frac{3000}{2} = 1500 \) students over 16.

Then, determine the number of male students among these 1500 over 16 years old.

One-fourth of the students over 16 years old are male, so there are \( \frac{1500}{4} = 375 \) male students over 16 years old.

Now, calculate the number of female students among these 1500 over 16 years old.

The remaining half of the students over 16 years old are female, so there are \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \) female students over 16 years old.

Next, determine the number of male students among the other 1500 students (under 16).

As stated earlier, one-half of the students under 16 years old are male, so there are \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \) male students under 16 years old.

Finally, calculate the number of female students among the other 1500 students (under 16 years old).

The remaining half of the students under 16 years old are female, so there are \( \frac{1500}{2} = 750 \) female students under 16 years old.

Adding all the female students together gives us the total number of female students in the school.

Total Female Students = Female Over 16 Years Old + Female Under 16 Years Old

"To calculate the time spent reading, we first find the time it takes to read one page:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of pages}} = \frac{10\text{ minutes}}{3\text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3}\text{ minutes/page} \]

Now, to find the total time spent reading 18 pages, we multiply this rate by the number of pages:

\[ \text{Total time reading} = \left(\frac{10}{3}\right)\times18\text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time reading} = 10\times6\text{ minutes} \]
\[ \text{Total time reading} = 60\text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

The answer is \(60\) minutes.

" The hotel originally had 100 guests.

24 guests elected an early checkout, so there were 100 - 24 = 76 guests left.

15 guests elected for a late checkout, so there were 76 - 15 = 61 guests left.

Twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, so 2 * 15 = 30 guests checked in in the afternoon.

Adding these to the number of guests already at the hotel, we get 61 + 30 = 91 guests.

7 more people checked in after dinner was served, so the final number of guests at the hotel is 91 + 7 = 98 guests.

Therefore, the hotel now has 98 guests.

"To calculate the number of points Aries can get from correct answers, we first need to determine the number of easy and difficult questions.

Given:
- The total number of items (questions) is 60.
- 40% of these are easy questions.
- The rest (60% - 40%) are equally divided into average and difficult questions.

First, let's find out how many easy questions there are:

\[ \text{Easy questions} = 40\% \times 60 = 0.40 \times 60 = 24 \]

Next, let's divide the rest of the questions into equal parts between average and difficult questions:

\[ \text{Average and difficult questions} = 60\% - 40\% = 20\%\]
\[ \text{Each group} = \frac{20\%}{2} = 10\%\]

Now, since 75% of the easy questions are right, Aries gets \(0.75 \times 24\) points from easy questions.

\[ \text{Points from easy questions} = 0.75 \times 24 = 18 \]

The remaining part of the questions is equally divided between average and difficult questions, so each type of question makes up half of the total. Since there are 20% of the total questions (average and difficult combined) that are average or difficult, and we've already accounted for 24 questions being easy, this leaves us with 16 questions that are either average or difficult.

Since half of these are average questions, and we know Aries gets 10% of the average questions right, she gets \(0.10 \times 16 = 1.6\) points from average questions.

Adding both types of correct answers together gives us the total points Aries is sure to get:

\[ \text{Total points} = 18 + 1.6 = 19.6 \]

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 19.6 points from correct answers."
" Let's say the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is \(x\). Since she sold twice as many large stuffed animals as small ones, the number of large stuffed animals she sold is \(2x\).

Each small stuffed animal costs $4, so the total amount she earned from selling small stuffed animals is \(4 \times x = 4x\) dollars.

She sells large stuffed animals for three times the price of small ones, so the price of each large stuffed animal is \(4 \times 3 = 12\) dollars.

The total amount she earned from selling large stuffed animals is \(12 \times 2x = 24x\) dollars.

We know that the total amount she earned from all the sales is $120, so we can set up the equation:

\[4x + 24x = 120\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[28x = 120\]

Dividing both sides by 28 gives us:

\[x = \frac{120}{28} = 4.2857...\]

However, since the number of stuffed animals must be a whole number, we round \(x\) down to the nearest whole number, which is 4.

Therefore, Teresa sold 4 small stuffed animals.

"To find out how much the package with 8 sandwiches would cost if the prices were proportional across all packages, we can use the information given about the first two packages.

First, let's understand what we know:

- The first package (with 2 sandwiches) costs $3. This means the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{3}{2} \) dollars.

- The second package (with 4 sandwiches) costs $6. This means the cost per sandwich is \( \frac{6}{4} \) dollars.

Now, knowing this, we want to find out the cost per sandwich for the third package (with 8 sandwiches). Since the prices are proportional, the cost per sandwich must also be \( \frac{6}{4} \) times the cost per sandwich for the second package.

Let's denote the cost per sandwich for the third package as \( S \).

Thus,
\[ S = \frac{6}{4} \times \frac{3}{2} = \frac{9}{4} \]

Therefore, the cost per sandwich for the third package is \( \frac{9}{4} \) dollars or \$2.25. 

Given that the third package has 8 sandwiches, the total cost for the third package is \( 8 \times 2.25 = \$18 \). 

Hence, the package with 8 sandwiches will cost \$18.

After losing the red balloons, she had 25 - 10 = 15 red balloons left.
She also had 7 green balloons, and there were no balloons lost or gained from them.
And she had 12 yellow balloons, but she accidentally released half of them, so she lost 12 * 0.50 = 6 yellow balloons.
After releasing the yellow balloons, she had 12 - 6 = 6 yellow balloons left.
In addition, she found 8 blue balloons in a tree and added 75% of them to her clutch, so she added 8 * 0.75 = 6 blue balloons to her clutch.
Adding these blue balloons to her remaining balloons, she had 15 (red) + 6 (yellow) + 6 (blue) = 27 balloons in her clutch when she arrived at the school.

"If you assume all these events occur independently, we can multiply their probabilities together.

Then, if he gets no homework due to this event, the probability that the normal teacher gives him an extension is 40%, or .4.

Next, even if the whole class gets extensions, the probability that Marcus convinces the teacher about the dog eating the homework is 20%, or .2.

Finally, multiplying these probabilities together:

"To calculate the total time Richard spends setting up his video, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of bottles (soda fountains) Richard needs to place on his driveway.
2. Since there are two sides of the driveway, multiply this number by 2.
3. To find the total time spent going from one soda fountain to the next, considering the speed of Richard (5 seconds).
4. Multiply the total number of bottles by the time taken between bottlenecks.

Step 1: Number of bottles needed
The width of Richard's driveway is 24 feet, and he places a bottle of soda every 3 feet. So, the number of bottles needed is \( \frac{24}{3} = 8 \).

Step 2: Total number of bottles
Richard needs 8 bottles to fill his driveway.

Step 3: Time spent going from one bottle to the next
Richard takes 5 seconds to go from one soda fountain to the next. Since there are 8 bottles, the total time spent would be \( 8 \times 5 = 40 \) seconds.

Step 4: Total time spent
To find the total time Richard spends setting up his video, we add the time spent going from one bottle to the next to the total number of bottles times the time taken between bottlenecks:

\( 40 \text{ seconds} + (8 \times 5) \text{ seconds} = 40 + 40 = 80 \text{ seconds} \)

Therefore, it will take Richard a total of 80 seconds to set off all the soda fountains.

He makes 300/365=.84 hours of work per day because 300/(365*.5) = .84
He used to make 250K/hour * .5 because 250/.5 = 250 and 12hrs/day = 250/.5 = 250
Now he makes 300K/hour so he can do 250/300 = 5/6 days because 300/.3 = 1000 and 12 hrs/day = 1000/.3 = 1000/.3 = 333.33

- From the second race: -9
- From the third race: -13.5

Total loss = -$5 - $9 - $13.5 = -$27.5

The question asks for the average loss over the three races. Since there were three races and they collectively resulted in a loss of $27.5, the average loss is calculated by dividing this total by the number of races:

"Let s represent the number of tennis balls Rory retrieved in the second set. Then, the number of balls he retrieved in the first set is s + 4.

The number of balls he retrieved in the third set is half the number of balls in the second, so it's \(s/2\).

Adding these together gives us the total number of balls he retrieved:

Multiplying through by 2 to clear the fraction gives:

\[s = 6.\]

Therefore, Rory retrieved 6 tennis balls in the second set, making him have retrieved 6 + 4 = 10 tennis balls in the first set. Adding the balls he got in the last two sets (half of what he got in the second set), we get 10 + 10/2 = 10 + 5 = 15 tennis balls in total.

So, Donovan's part took 40 minutes. To find Betsy's part, we add the extra 18 minutes to Donovan's part:

\[Betsy's \ Part = D + 18\]
\[Betsy's \ Part = 40 + 18\]
\[Betsy's \ Part = 58\]

Therefore, Betsy's part of the meal was 58 minutes long.

" Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, and since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, he needs to make 6 x 12 = 72 croissants.
He uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, so he will need 72 pounds of butter.
The grocery store has a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get half off the second pound at no extra cost. So for every pound of butter, he gets two pounds for the price of one.
If he needs 72 pounds of butter, he will receive 72 x 2 = 144 pounds of butter for the price of 72 pounds.
The cost of the 72 pounds of butter is 72 x $4 = $288.
For the additional 144 pounds of butter, he gets the second pound free, so the cost is 144 x $4 = $576.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, so Jenny gets 15/12 = 1.25 dozens of roses, which rounds down to 1 dozen because you can't buy a fraction of a dozen.

The cost of 1 dozen roses is $15, so the cost of 1.25 dozen roses is 1.25 * $15 = $18.75.

Jenny paid with five $5 bills, so she paid a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

After paying the bill, Jenny has $25 - $18.75 = $6.25 left as change.

Each quarter is worth $0.25, so to find out how many quarters Jenny has left, we divide the amount of change by the value of each quarter: $6.25 / $0.25 = 25.

The second train stays in the station for a quarter of the time that the first train stayed in the station. Since the first train stayed for 20 minutes, the second train stays for 20/4 = 5 minutes.

Adding up the time for the first two trains, we have 30 minutes (first train) + 50 minutes (second train) = 80 minutes spent waiting for the first two trains.

The third train arrives an hour (or 60 minutes) after the second train leaves the station. So the third train arrives in 60 minutes + 50 minutes = 110 minutes.

The third train also stays in the station for a quarter of the time that the first train stayed in the station, or 20/4 = 5 minutes.

Adding up the time for the first three trains, we have 80 minutes (waiting for the first two trains) + 110 minutes (third train) = 190 minutes spent waiting for the first three trains.

Finally, the fourth train arrives 20 minutes after the third train leaves the station. Since the third train arrived in 110 minutes, the fourth train arrives in 110 + 20 = 130 minutes.

"To calculate the percentage discount obtained by Mr. Rogers' friend, we first determine the selling price after Mr. Rogers bought the watch.

The watch originally cost $2000 and Mr. Rogers bought it at 75% of its original price, meaning he paid \(2000 \times 0.75\).

Let's calculate this:

\[Selling Price = 2000 \times 0.75 = \$1500.\]

Now, Mr. Rogers then sells the watch to his friend at 120% of the price he bought it for, which amounts to \(1500 \times 1.20\) or approximately \(1800\) dollars.

The difference between the buying price and the selling price is:

\[Difference = Selling Price - Buying Price = 1800 - 1500 = \$300.\]

To find the percentage discount, we use the formula:

\[\text{Discount Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Original Price} - \text{Selling Price}}{\text{Original Price}} \right) \times 100\%\]

Substituting the values we have:

\[\text{Discount Percentage} = \left( \frac{1500 - 1800}{1500} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{-300}{1500} \right) \times 100\% = -20\%\]

However, since percentages cannot be negative, there seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem statement. The discount percentage would actually be positive if calculated correctly. 

Given the context, let's correct the calculation:

The correct calculation should reflect the fact that Mr. Rogers received a discount from the original price, not increased the price. To get the correct discount, we should subtract the amount he paid (the original price minus what he got back in the form of profit) from the selling price:

\[Profit = Original Price - Selling Price = 2000 - 1800 = \$200.\]

The discount can now be calculated as:

\[\text{Discount} = \frac{\text{Profit}}{\text{Original Price}} \times 100\% = \frac{200}{2000} \times 100\% = 10\%\]

Therefore, Mr. Rogers' friend got a 10% discount from the original price when purchasing the watch.

#### 10%

Alternatively, if you meant to ask about the percentage increase, not decrease, the calculation would be slightly different but the result would still be positive. Let's adjust the calculation:

If Mr. Rogers received a 10% discount from the original price, it means he actually paid 90% of the original price. This implies that the selling price represents the 90% of the original price, not 100%. So, if the selling price is 1800 dollars, the original price must have been \(1800 / 0.90 = 2000\) dollars.

The discount is then calculated using the same formula as before:

\[Discount = \left( \frac{2000 - 1800}{2000} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{200}{2000} \right) \times 100\% = 10\%\]

Thus, even though the interpretation may initially seem counterintuitive due to the incorrect calculation method used, the percentage discount Mr. Rogers' friend receives is indeed 10%.

In conclusion, regardless of the initial misunderstanding in interpreting the question, the correct calculation shows that Mr. Rogers' friend gets a 10% discount from the original price when purchasing the watch.

"To find out how much money Jenny saved, we first calculate the total number of bananas she bought.

Jenny buys 10 bunches with an average of 4 bananas per bunch. So, she buys:

\[10 \text{ bunches} \times 4 \text{ bananas/bunch} = 40 \text{ bananas}\]

Now, let's calculate the cost if she bought them individually. The cost of one banana is $0.80, so the total cost for 40 bananas would be:

\[40 \text{ bananas} \times \$0.80/\text{banana} = \$32.00\]

Next, let's calculate the cost if she bought them in bunches. A bunch costs $3.00, so the cost for 40 bananas would be:

\[40 \text{ bunches} \times \$3.00/\text{bunch} = \$120.00\]

Finally, we subtract the two amounts to find out how much money Jenny saved:

\[\$120.00 - \$32.00 = \$88.00\]

Therefore, Jenny saved $88.00 by buying the bananas in bunches instead of individually.

"Let's denote the amount of fencing Sam gets as \(S\) and the amount of fencing Harry gets as \(H\). According to the problem:

\[S + H = 100 \quad \text{(1)}\]

It also states that Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express this relationship as:

\[H = S + 60\]

Substituting the second equation into the first gives us:

\[S + (S + 60) = 100\]

Combining like terms simplifies to:

\[2S + 60 = 100\]

Subtracting 60 from both sides gives:

\[2S = 40\]

Dividing both sides by 2 yields:

\[S = 20\]

Now, to find out how much is left over for Sam, we subtract his share (\(S = 20\) feet) from the total shared fencing (\(100\) feet):

\[100 - 20 = 80\]

Sam is left with 80 feet of fencing.

Therefore, there is \(80\) feet of fencing left over for Sam.

"If we assume the number of bikes sold under each category are MMTB, MBX, and TREK respectively, then:

\[M + B + T = 300\]

Given that:
- M = 300/2 = 150 (since half of the bikes sold were Trekking)
- B = 150/100 = 1.5 (since 15% of the bikes sold were BMX)

We know the prices of the bikes are given as follows:

- MTB = $500
- BMX = $500/2 = $250
- Trekking = $450

To find the total earnings from these sales, multiply the quantity of each type of bike by its corresponding price and sum them up.

\[Earnings = (MTB \times Price) + (BMX \times Price) + (Trekking \times Price)\]
\[Earnings = (150 \times 500) + (1.5 \times 250) + (150 \times 450)\]
\[Earnings = 75000 + 375 + 67500\]
\[Earnings = 145250\]

"The farmer can make 5 bales an hour, while the truck can pick up 3 bales an hour. So together they make 5 + 3 = 8 bales an hour.

They work for 6 hours a day, so in one day they can collect 8 * 6 = 48 bales.

If there were no other factors affecting it, this would mean there would be 0 bales left after a full day of work.

However, if you consider that these numbers represent a hypothetical situation where the truck doesn't take any bales during the farmer's working hours, we must subtract those from the total collected. 

Thus, at the end of the day, there will be 48 - 6 = 42 bales of hay left in the field.

"To find out how high the ball goes on its second bounce, we first calculate the height reached after the first bounce:

The ball starts at 2/3rd of its original height.

Given that Nathan dropped the ball from a third-story balcony (which is 24 feet high) and this height represents 2/3 of its starting height, let's denote the starting height as \(H\). Then, the height after the first bounce (\(H_b\) or \((2/3)H\)) can be calculated using the formula:

\[H_b = \frac{2}{3}H\]

Substituting the given height of the balcony into the equation gives us:

\[H_b = \frac{2}{3} \times 24\]
\[H_b = \frac{48}{3}\]
\[H_b = 16\] feet

Therefore, the ball reaches a height of 16 feet on its first bounce.

For the second bounce, the ball will again reach 2/3rd of its first bounce height:

\[H_{b2} = \left(\frac{2}{3}\right)(16)\]
\[H_{b2} = \frac{32}{3}\] feet

So, the ball reaches a height of approximately 10.67 feet on its second bounce. However, since the question asks about the height going up, we typically round down to the nearest whole number because you cannot jump up 0.67 feet. Therefore, the ball goes up 10 feet on its second bounce.

"Let's denote the original amount of meat (the triceratops) as \(x\). According to the problem:

1. The first part of the scenario involves the T-Rex eating half of the triceratops, so it eats \(\frac{x}{2}\).
2. After the T-Rex has eaten its share, a pack of velociraptors eat half of what remains. This means they eat \(\frac{1}{2} \times \frac{x}{2} = \frac{x}{4}\).

The final piece of information given is that a group of Allosaurus ate up to 270 kilograms.

Putting these together, we have:
\[ \frac{x}{2} + \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]

To solve this equation, we'll find a common denominator for the fractions, which is 4, so we rewrite our equation as:
\[ \frac{2x}{4} + \frac{x}{4} = 270 \]
\[ \frac{3x}{4} = 270 \]

Solving for \(x\) gives us:
\[ 3x = 270 \times 4 \]
\[ 3x = 1080 \]
\[ x = \frac{1080}{3} \]
\[ x = 360 \]

Therefore, there were originally 360 kilograms of meat on the triceratops before the T-Rex ate it.

"To find out how much it will cost to paint the room, we first need to calculate the area of all four walls.

The area of one wall (north or south) is \(10 \times 8\) square feet because each wall is 10 feet wide and 8 feet tall.

Since there are two walls of this size, the total area covered by these two walls is \(2 \times 10 \times 8 = 160\) square feet.

Similarly, the area of one wall (east or west) is \(5 \times 8\) square feet because each wall is 5 feet wide and 8 feet tall.

Again, since there are two walls of this size, the total area covered by these two walls is \(2 \times 5 \times 8 = 80\) square feet.

Adding these areas together gives us the total area to be painted:

Total area = \(160 + 80 = 240\) square feet.

Given that a gallon of paint covers 20 square feet, Tony will need \(240 \div 20 = 12\) gallons of paint.

If each gallon costs $12, then the total cost will be \(12 \times 12 = \$\$144\).

"The probability of something happening is calculated as follows:

- The number of ways it could happen divided by the total number of possible outcomes.

In this case, we're dealing with the probabilities of specific events (taking a soda from the case) happening under specific conditions (specific people taking or not taking a soda).

Firstly, Ellen shakes 3 sodas from the 12 she had. This means there are 9 sodas left, and she keeps one for herself.

Then, Ellen's brother takes 1 of these 9 sodas. So now, there are 8 sodas left, and Ellen's brother also takes 1 of those. That leaves us with 7 sodas left. 

Finally, Ellen's friend comes along and either takes one of the shaken sodas or doesn't take any. There are still 7 sodas left.

So, the probability that Ellen's friend gets sprayed with soda from a shaken can is the number of ways they could get sprayed divided by the total number of outcomes.

The total number of outcomes is the number of ways Ellen's friend could have gotten sprayed, which is 1 (they would either take a shaken soda or not). 

Therefore, the probability is \( \frac{1}{1} = 100\% \), meaning there's a 100% chance that Ellen's friend will get sprayed with soda from a shaken can if Ellen's brother and Ellen's friend both take a soda.

The likelihood, expressed as a percentage, is therefore 100%.

**Note:** The exact calculation of the number of ways they could get sprayed would depend on the specifics of their interactions and the rules of the game, but the core concept remains the same based on the given information.

"To find out how far apart the two trains are from each other after 3 hours, we can use the formula:

First, let's calculate the speed of both trains:
- The first train travels at 60 miles/hour,
- The second train travels at \(60 \div 2 = 30\) miles/hour.

Next, we'll calculate the distance traveled by each train over 3 hours:
- For the first train (at 60 mph), it will travel \(60 \times 3 = 180\) miles.
- For the second train (at 30 mph), it will travel \(30 \times 3 = 90\) miles.

Finally, to find the total distance between them after 3 hours, we add these distances together:

Next, she buys a frying pan that was on sale for 20% off $20.00.
The discount on the frying pan is 20% of $20.00, which is (20/100) * $20.00 = $4.00.
So the price of the frying pan after the discount is $20.00 - $4.00 = $16.00.
She adds this purchase to her credit card, increasing her balance to $70.00 + $16.00 = $86.00.

Then she buys a set of towels that was 10% off $30.00.
The discount on the towels is 10% of $30.00, which is (10/100) * $30.00 = $3.00.
So the price of the towels after the discount is $30.00 - $3.00 = $27.00.
Adding this purchase to her credit card, her balance becomes $86.00 + $27.00 = $113.00.

Therefore, the new balance on her credit card is $113.00.

"If there were originally 6 jellyfish that changed color when the UV light turned on, and these represent 1/3rd of the large jellyfish, then there must have been \(6 \times 3 = 18\) large jellyfish in total.

Given that a fifth of the jellyfish are large, we can calculate the total number of jellyfish in the tank by setting up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{5} \times \text{(Total number of jellyfish)} = 18

Solving for the total number of jellyfish gives us:

\[
\text{Total number of jellyfish} = 18 \times 5 = 90

"To find out how many more years Lauren needs to work, we first calculate the amount she saves from her current salary and then determine how much she will have saved after 20 years.

First, let's calculate how much Lauren saves per month:

\[ \text{Amount saved} = \$100,000 \times 20\% = \$100,000 \times 0.20 = \$20,000 \]

Next, we'll divide this monthly savings by the number of months in a year to get the annual savings:

\[ \text{Annual Savings} = \$20,000 \div 12 = \$1,666.67 \]

Now, we know Lauren saves approximately $1,666.67 per month. Over 20 years (or 240 months), she would save:

\[ \text{Total Savings} = \$1,666.67 \times 240 = \$399,999.60 \]

Finally, to find out how much she needs to reach her goal of saving for 20 years, we subtract her total savings from her desired retirement amount:

\[ \text{Retirement Goal Amount} = \$100,000 \]
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$100,000 - \$399,999.60 = -$299,999.60 \]

This result indicates that Lauren doesn't have enough savings yet to meet her retirement goals without working additional years. Since she currently makes $100,000 and aims to live off 40% of her salary, her desired annual spending is:

\[ \text{Desired Spending} = \$100,000 \times 40\% = \$40,000 \]

Her remaining balance after 20 years would need to cover this additional spending:

\[ \text{Remaining Balance Needed} = \$40,000 - \$299,999.60 = -$259,999.60 \]

Again, this calculation shows that Lauren falls short by nearly $260,000 before she can achieve her goal. This suggests she must work an additional 20 years or longer to save enough for her retirement. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for at least another 20 years to reach her retirement goal.

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total student population based on the information given.

Given:
- 40% of the school population consists of boys, with 240 boys being part of this group.
- The percentage of boys (which represents the students) is 40%.

First, calculate the total student population by finding what percentage of the total student population is represented by 240 boys:

\[ \text{Percentage of boys} = 40\%
\]
\[ \text{Number of boys} = 240
\]

The formula to find the total population (\(T\)) when you know the percentage (\(\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}\)) and the value (\(\text{Value}\)) is:
\[ T = \frac{\text{Value}}{\frac{\text{Part}}{\text{Whole}}} \]

Substituting the known values gives us:
\[ T = \frac{240}{\frac{40}{100}}
\]
\[ T = 240 \times \frac{100}{40}
\]
\[ T = 60 \times 100
\]
\[ T = 6000
\]

Now, knowing the total student population is 6000, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from the total population:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = T - \text{Number of boys}
\]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 6000 - 240
\]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 5760
\]

Therefore, there are 5760 girls in the school.

Therefore, the total height of all the heels at the party is 12 + 6 = 18 inches.

To find the average height of heels, we divide the total height by the number of women. So, the average height of heels is 18 / 6 = 3 inches.

"Soledad plans to cover a distance of 9,300 miles during her trip.

She hikes twice a day and covers 125 miles each time, so she hikes a total of \(2 \times 125\) miles each day.

The total number of days in June is 30.

To find out how many more miles per day Soledad needs to hike, we subtract the daily mileage from her planned total:

\(9,300 - (2 \times 125) = 9,300 - 250 = 9,050\) miles.

Soledad needs to hike 9,050 miles over the course of the month.

Therefore, to complete her journey on time, Soledad must hike \(9,050 / 30 = 301.67\) miles per day.

However, since she can't hike a fraction of a mile, she would need to hike at least 302 miles per day to make up the difference and complete her journey on time.

Then it sells all the blue balls at $5 each.

After selling the blue balls, there are still 25 green balls left.

Finally, the store sells the green balls at $3 each.

Red balls price: 3 red balls * $9/red ball = $27
Blue balls price: 11 blue balls * $5/blue ball = $55
Green balls price: 25 green balls * $3/green ball = $75

Total revenue from selling all the balls = $27 (red) + $55 (blue) + $75 (green) = $157

- Female goldfishes: 5

Tate adds:
- Male guppies: 2 (initially none)
- Female guppies: 1 (initially none)

- Female goldfishes: 3 (initially none)

Now, let's add these to the existing numbers:

Male guppies: \(4 + 2 = 6\)
Female guppies: \(7 + 1 = 8\)
Male goldfishes: \(3 + 2 = 5\)
Female goldfishes: \(5 + 3 = 8\)

Total fish now: \(6 + 8 + 5 + 8 = 27\)

The difference between the number of female fish and male fish is:
\(8 \text{ (female)} - 6 \text{ (male)} = 2\) 

Therefore, Tate has 2 more female fishes than male fishes in his garden pond."

Dior's chores were 4 hours longer than Amalia's, so:
- Doing laundry took her \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's calculate the total time taken by all three:

- Total time taken by Amalia = 4 hours
- Total time taken by Megan = 6 hours
- Total time taken by Dior = 8 hours

Adding these together gives us the total time spent on chores:

In total, these four groups of workers produce \(12 + 8 = 20\) toys per hour.

If there are 5 workers in total, and we have accounted for 4 of them, then the fifth worker must be producing \(400 - (12 + 8) = 400 - 20 = 380\) toys in total over the course of the day.

" Let's say Seth had \(x\) stickers in the beginning.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis got \(\frac{x}{2}\) stickers.

Luis then used half of these stickers, so he used \(\frac{\frac{x}{2}}{2} = \frac{x}{4}\) stickers.

After using these stickers, Luis had \(\frac{x}{4}\) stickers left.

Then, Luis gave these stickers to Kris. So Kris received \(\frac{x}{4}\) stickers.

We know that Kris kept 9 stickers and gave the remaining 7 stickers to Rob. This means that the number of stickers Kris received (\(\frac{x}{4}\)) plus 7 equals 9.

So we can set up the equation:

\[\frac{x}{4} + 7 = 9.\]

To solve for \(x\), we first subtract 7 from both sides of the equation:

\[\frac{x}{4} = 9 - 7 = 2.\]

Next, we multiply both sides of the equation by 4 to isolate \(x\):

\[x = 2 \times 4 = 8.\]

So, Seth originally had 8 stickers in the beginning.

"Let's denote the number of eggs each person painted as follows:

- A for Arnold,
- M for Madeline,
- C for Camden,
- S for Sarah.

From the problem statement, we have two equations based on the information provided:

1. The total number of eggs painted by all four individuals is 56:
\[A + M + C + S = 56\]

2. Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah:
\[C + S = 30 \quad \text{and} \quad C = S + 12\]

Substituting the second equation into the first gives us:

\[A + M + (S + 12) + S = 56\]
\[A + M + 2S + 12 = 56\]
\[A + M + 2S = 44\]   (Equation 1)

Now let's solve this system of equations. We know from the second equation that \(C = S + 12\), so substituting this into Equation 1 gives:

\[A + M + 2(S + 12) = 44\]
\[A + M + 2S + 24 = 44\]
\[A + M + 2S = 20\]   (Equation 2)

We now have a system with one fewer variable compared to our original equation. Let's solve it:

\[A + M + 2S = 20\]

We also know that \(C + S = 30\) and \(C = S + 12\). Let's substitute \(C\) from the third equation into the fourth equation:

\[S + 12 + S = 30\]
\[2S = 18\]
\[S = 9\]

Now we can find \(M\) and \(C\):

\[C = S + 12 = 9 + 12 = 21\]
\[C + S = 30\]
\[21 + 9 = 30\]

Therefore, \(C = 21\) and \(S = 9\).

Finally, we can find \(A\) using \(A + M + 2S = 20\):
\[A + M + 2(9) = 20\]
\[A + M + 18 = 20\]
\[A + M = 2\]

So, Arnold painted 2 pages, Madeline painted 2 pages, Camden painted 21 pages, and Sarah painted 9 pages. To find out how many more pages Camden painted than Arnold, subtract the number of pages Arnold painted from the number of pages Camden painted:

"To find out how long Grandma spends walking on the beach, we first calculate the time spent walking on the sidewalk. She walks 2 miles on the beach and 1 mile on the sidewalk.

If 40 minutes represent 40 minutes of walking on the beach, then 1 minute represents \( \frac{40}{40} = 1 \) minute of walking on the beach.

For the 2 miles on the beach, this takes 2 minutes (since \( 1 \text{ minute} \times 2 \text{ miles} = 2 \text{ minutes} \)).

Therefore, the time spent walking on the sidewalk is \( 1 \text{ minute} \times 1 \text{ mile} = 1 \text{ minute} \).

The total distance walked is 3 miles, so the time spent walking on the sidewalk plus the time spent walking on the beach equals the total time spent:

Given that Donny can only drink water when it's at least 40 degrees, let's denote the temperature of the second bottle as \(T\) degrees. After pouring these 5 ounces of water, the total volume of water Donny has will be \(5 + T\) ounces.

Since he can only drink water at temperatures above 40 degrees, and we know he can't drink any water below 40 degrees, the total volume of water must be less than or equal to 40 ounces. Therefore,

\[ 5 + T \leq 40 \]

Solving for \(T\), we subtract 5 from both sides to get:

2. It takes 3 less than 6 potatoes to make 1 less than 3 scoops of mashed potatoes.
   To find the number of potatoes required to make 1 scoop of mashed potatoes, we first convert scoops to potatoes based on the provided ratio (1 scoop = 3 potatoes).

"To calculate the total number of eggs Chester will consume over 60 days, we first determine his daily egg consumption.

For the first 30 days, he eats 3 eggs a day:

For the next 30 days, he increases this to 5 eggs a day:

\[ \text{Eggs for the second period} = 5\, \text{eggs/day} \times 30\, \text{days} = 150\, \text{eggs} \]

Adding these together gives us the total number of eggs consumed over 60 days:

\[ \text{Total Eggs} = 90\, \text{eggs (first period)} + 150\, \text{eggs (second period)} = 240\, \text{eggs} \]

Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens Chester will need:

\[ \text{Dozens of Eggs} = \frac{240\, \text{eggs}}{12\, \text{eggs/dozen}} = 20\, \text{dozens} \]

We know that he sells 60% of his inventory, so he keeps 60% of his profit.

Let's say he buys 100/5 = 20 rocks, which would mean he spends $5*20 = $100.

Then he sells 60% of his inventory, which is 60/100*20 = 12 rocks.

So his profit from selling those rocks is 12*$7-$100 = $96-$100 = -$4.

But since we want to find out how much money he loses, we subtract his profit from his initial investment:

$100 - $4 = $96

So Adam loses $96 when he invests all his money in the rock stand but only sells 60% of his inventory.

"To find the average speed for both trips combined, we first calculate the total distance traveled and the total time taken.

For the first trip:
- Distance = 110 miles
- Time = 2 hours

Average speed for the first part = Total distance / Total time
\[ \text{Speed}_1 = \frac{110 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 55 \text{ mph} \]

For the second trip:
- Distance = 140 miles
- Time = 3 hours

Average speed for the second part = Total distance / Total time
\[ \text{Speed}_2 = \frac{140 \text{ miles}}{3 \text{ hours}} = 46.\overline{6} \text{ mph} \]

The combined average speed over the two trips is the weighted average of the two speeds:
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \left( \frac{\text{Speed}_1}{\text{Time}_1} \right) + \left( \frac{\text{Speed}_2}{\text{Time}_2} \right) \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \left( \frac{55}{2} \right) + \left( \frac{46.\overline{6}}{3} \right) \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \frac{55}{2} + \frac{46.\overline{6}}{3} \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \frac{55 \times 3}{2 \times 3} + \frac{46.\overline{6} \times 2}{3} \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \frac{165}{6} + \frac{93}{3} \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \frac{165}{6} + \frac{93}{3} \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \frac{165 + 93}{6} \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = \frac{258}{6} \]
\[ \text{Combined Speed} = 43.333... \text{ mph} \]

Therefore, the average speed at which Sid traveled during the entire period is approximately 43.33 miles per hour (rounded to three decimal places).

" The first ticket has a 20% chance of winning, so there's a 20% chance that Mark wins this ticket.
The second ticket is three times more likely to win than the first ticket, so it has a 20% * 3 = 60% chance of winning.
To find the probability that both tickets are winners, we multiply the probabilities of each individual event happening: 20% * 60% = 12%
Expressed as a percentage, this is 12%. So the probability that both tickets are winners is 12%.

"Jim collected 27 seashells, which was 5 more than what Carlos collected. So, Carlos collected 27 - 5 = 22 seashells.

Carlos collected twice as many as Carrey. Since we know Carlos collected 22 seashells, we can find out how many Carrey collected by dividing Carlos' collection by 2:

22 ÷ 2 = 11 seashells.

Now we have the number of seashells each person collected:
- Carlos: 22 seashells
- Jim: 27 seashells
- Carrey: 11 seashells

When they divide the seashells equally among themselves, each person gets:
Carlos: 22 ÷ 3 ≈ 7.33 (but since you can't share a fraction of a seashell, Carlos would get 7 seashells)
Jim: 27 ÷ 3 = 9 seashells
Carrey: 11 seashells

So, each person got approximately 7, 9, and 11 seashells respectively.

"To find the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple, we first determine the number of babies who are both purple (wearing purple) and blue (wearing blue), and then calculate this proportion against the total number of babies.

Given:
- Carla gives birth to 8 babies (4 sets of twins with 2 babies each).
- 3/4 of these babies are dressed in purple and 1/4 are dressed in blue.
- All blue-wearers and 1/3 of the purple-wearers also wear bows.

Let's break down the information:

1. Total Number of Babies:
\[ \text{Total} = 8 \]

2. Purple-Wearers:
\[ \text{Purple} = \frac{3}{4} \times 8 = 6 \]
\[ \text{Blue} = \frac{1}{4} \times 8 = 2 \]

3. Blue-Wearers and Purple-Wearers Who Also Wear Bows:
- The 2 blue-wearers also wear bows.
- The 6 purple-wearers (who are not blue-wearers) also wear bows.

So, there are \(2 + 6 = 8\) babies who are either purple or blue and also wear bows.

4. Percentage Chance a Baby is Wearing a Bow and is Purple:
\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{\text{Babies Wearing Bow}}{\text{Total Babies}} \right) \times 100\% = \left( \frac{8}{8} \right) \times 100\% = 100\% \]

Therefore, the percentage chance that a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 100%. This means all the purple-wearers who also wear bows are counted towards the overall percentage, regardless of whether they were originally considered as part of the group of purple-wearers or the group of blue-wearers.

In summary, the percentage chance a baby wearing a bow is wearing purple is 100%, based on the information provided.

"To find out how many reports were received on Wednesday, we first calculate the number of reports received over the two days from Monday through Friday.

From Monday and Tuesday, the IRS received 1907 reports.
From Thursday and Friday, the IRS received 2136 reports.

The total number of reports received from Monday through Friday is \(1907 + 2136 = 4043\) reports.

Given that the IRS received 5168 tax reports last week, we subtract this total from the weekly average to find out how many reports were received on Wednesday.

\(5168 - 4043 = 1125\)

Therefore, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

" Abraham initially owned 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, which is 80/2 = 40 square meters, for $50. So, he earned 40*$50 = $2000 from this sale.

Then, he sold another quarter of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters, for $30. So, he earned 20*$30 = $600 from this sale.

After these two sales, he had 80 - 40 - 20 = 20 square meters of land left.

He sold this remaining land at $3 per square meter, so he earned 20*$3 = $60 from this sale.

To find out how much money he will be able to earn in total, we add up the earnings from all three sales: $2000 + $600 + $60 = $2660.

2. **6-Year-Old Tree**: Produces \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.
3. **7-Year-Old Tree**: Produces \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) fruits.
4. **8-Year-Old Tree**: Produces \(1050 - 200 = 850\) fruits (since it produces 200 fewer fruits than a 10-year-old).
5. **9-Year-Old Tree**: No fruit produced because it doesn't produce fruit during this year.
6. **10-Year-Old Tree**: Produces \(1050 \times 20 = 21000\) fruits.

Adding these up gives us the total number of fruits:

\[50 + 150 + 1050 + 850 + 0 + 21000 = 24100\]

Therefore, the avocado tree can produce a total of 24,100 fruits over its 10-year lifespan.

"Let's denote the lengths of the red, blue, and yellow ropes respectively as R, B, and Y.

From the information given:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope, so we can express this relationship as \(R = 4B\).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters (cm) shorter than the yellow rope, so we have \(B = Y - 7\).
3. The sum of the lengths of all three ropes is 37 cm, so we have \(R + B + Y = 37\) cm.

Substituting the expressions for \(R\) and \(B\) from points 1 and 2 into point 3 gives us:

\(4B + B + Y = 37\)

Combining like terms gives us:

\(5B + Y = 37\)

Now, substituting the expression for \(B\) from point 2 into the equation above gives us:

\(5(Y - 7) + Y = 37\)

Expanding and simplifying gives us:

\(5Y - 35 + Y = 37\)

Combining like terms again gives us:

\(6Y - 35 = 37\)

Adding 35 to both sides gives us:

\(6Y = 72\)

Dividing both sides by 6 gives us:

\(Y = 12\) cm

Now that we know the length of the yellow rope (\(Y = 12\) cm), we can find the lengths of the red and blue ropes using the relationships \(R = 4B\) and \(B = Y - 7\):

For the red rope (\(R\)):

\(R = 4B = 4 \times (12 - 7)\)
\(R = 4 \times 5\)
\(R = 20\) cm

And for the blue rope (\(B\)):

\(B = Y - 7 = 12 - 7\)
\(B = 5\) cm

Therefore, the length of the red rope is 20 cm and the blue rope is 5 cm.

" The total amount of paint used in the mural is divided into four parts: red, white, purple, and yellow. We know that half of the mural is yellow, so we can say that the ratio of red, white, purple, and yellow paint is 1:1:1:1.

Let's assume that there are $x$ units of each color of paint. Then the total amount of paint used in the mural is $4x$ units.

We also know that the total amount of paint used in the mural is 12 pints. So we have the equation $4x = 12$, which simplifies to $x = \frac{12}{4} = 3$. This means that there are 3 units of each color of paint.

Since there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, and there are 3 units of each color, the amount of red paint used is $\frac{3}{4}$ times the total amount of paint used in the mural.

To find this, we multiply the total amount of paint used (12 pints) by $\frac{3}{4}$:

$$\frac{3}{4} \times 12 = 9.$$Therefore, the amount of red paint used is 9 pints.
The answer is: $9$"

The rest of the house is 1000 square feet.
To find the total area of the house, we add the areas of the bedrooms, the living room, and the rest of the house: 960 + 1200 + 1000 = 3160 square feet.

To find the total number of pizza pies Kate needs to buy, we add the number of cheese pizzas and pepperoni pizzas together, so 4.333333333333333 (cheese pizzas) + 6.5 (pepperoni pizzas) = 10.833333333333333.
Since you can't have a fraction of a pizza pie, Kate needs to buy 11 pizza pies in total.

" Sam ran 3 miles on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, so he ran a total of 3 x 3 = 9 miles on those days.
On Tuesday and Thursday, Sam ran 5 miles each day, so he ran a total of 5 x 2 = 10 miles on those days.
To find the total number of miles Sam ran this week, we add the miles from the three days with fixed mileage (Monday, Wednesday, and Friday) and the miles from the two days with variable mileage (Tuesday and Thursday).
So, Sam ran a total of 9 + 10 = 19 miles this week.

"Let's denote John's current age as J and Jim's current age as K.

From the information given:

1. **John's Current Age**: \(J = 28\)
2. **John's Age when it came out**: \(J - 20 = 28 - 20 = 8\) (because John was twice as old as Jim when it came out).
3. **John's Relationship with Jim**: \(J = 2K\)

Now we can set up the equations based on these relationships:

\[8 = 2K\]

To find \(K\), divide both sides by 2:

\[K = \frac{8}{2} = 4\]

Therefore, Jim is currently 4 years old.

**Jim's Age**: \(K = 4\)

John is now 28 years old, so he must have been 20 years old when Digimon came out. This matches our calculation from the relationship between their ages, \(J = 2K\). So, we don't need to adjust anything else.

**Jim's Age**: \(K = 4\)

Therefore, Jim is currently 4 years old.

- Day 2: 38 - 10 = 28 bandages used
- Day 3: (1/2) * 50 = 25 bandages used
- Day 3: 78 bandages left

We know that the total bandage usage over three days plus the bandages left equals the initial quantity of bandages. So we have:

Simplifying this gives:

B = 169

Therefore, they started with 169 bandages on the first day.

In a month with 4 weeks, she works a total of 45 x 4 = 180 hours.
If she received an additional $10 for complete attendance, she would have earned an additional 180 x $10 = $1800.
Her hourly rate is $1.5, so she would have earned 180 x $1.5 = $2700 from working 180 hours.

" First, let's find out how much Jason earned each week.

He earned $3.00 for doing his laundry, $1.50 for cleaning his room, $0.75 for taking the trash to the curb, and $0.50 for emptying the dishwasher.

In one week, he earned $3.00 + $1.50 + $0.75 + $0.50 = $5.50.

Now, we know that he did his laundry once in one week, so in two weeks, he did his laundry 2 times.

Therefore, in two weeks, he earned $5.50 \times 2 = $11.00 from doing his laundry.

He also cleaned his room once in one week, so in two weeks, he cleaned his room 2 times.

Therefore, in two weeks, he earned $0.50 \times 2 = $1.00 from cleaning his room.

He emptied the dishwasher 6 times in one week, so in two weeks, he emptied the dishwasher 6 \times 2 = 12 times.

Therefore, in two weeks, he earned $0.75 \times 12 = $9.00 from emptying the dishwasher.

Adding up all these amounts, Jason earned $11.00 + $1.00 + $9.00 = $21.00 in two weeks.

Then, an additional 3 times the number of people from the morning have also come in, so that would be:

3 * 50 = 150 people

To find the total number of people by evening, add all these together:

Now, let's find out how many fish remain after removing those with red stripes:

\[ \text{Remaining fish after removing red striped fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Next, we determine how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[ \text{Number of blue striped fish} = \frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Finally, to find the total number of fish with both red and blue stripes:

\[ \text{Total fish with red or blue stripes} = \text{Red striped fish} + \text{Blue striped fish} = 22 + 20 = 42 \]

" Mattison's height is 60 inches.

The two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the first floor is \(7 \times 60 = 420\) inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is thrice as high as he is, so it is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) inches.

The total height of the first floor is the sum of its length (which is 420 inches) and its width (which is 180 inches), so it is \(420 + 180 = 600\) inches.

Since the two-story house is composed of two floors, the combined height of the two floors is \(600 + 420 = 1020\) inches.

"To find Trinity's profit, we first calculate the selling price per magazine after the discount and then multiply it by the number of magazines she sold.

Given that Trinity bought the magazines at $72 and sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the original price, let's calculate the selling price per magazine:

\[ \text{Selling Price per Magazine} = \frac{\text{Original Price}}{\text{Discount Percentage}} = \frac{72}{\frac{11}{8}} = 72 \times \frac{8}{11} = \frac{576}{11} \]

Now, let's find the total profit by multiplying the selling price per magazine by the number of magazines sold (which is 2):

\[ \text{Total Profit} = (\text{Selling Price per Magazine}) \times (\text{Number of Magazines Sold}) = \left( \frac{576}{11} \right) \times 2 \]

\[ \text{Profit} = \frac{576}{11} \times 2 = \frac{576}{11} \times \frac{2}{1} = \frac{576}{11} \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is approximately $\$53.91$. However, since profit typically refers to monetary value, we might consider rounding this to the nearest dollar or cent, but without additional context about whether the calculation involves precise numbers or if there's supposed to be no rounding involved, the exact numerical result remains $\$53.91$.

" First, let's find out the volume of the jar. The volume of a rectangular prism (like the jar) is given by the formula length x width x height. So the volume of the jar is 6 x 6 x 15 = 540 cubic inches.

Next, we know that the jelly beans are packed efficiently with about 80% efficiency, so the number of jelly beans that can fit into the jar is 540 / 0.8 = 675 jelly beans.

We also know that 30% of the jelly beans are red, so the number of red jelly beans is 675 x 0.3 = 202.5 jelly beans.

However, the true number of red jelly beans is only 900, so Tim's guess was 900 - 202.5 = 697.5 jelly beans too high.

To find out how far off his guess was, we subtract the actual number from his estimate: 697.5 - 900 = -202.5. This means Tim's guess was 202.5 jelly beans too low.

However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question. It doesn't seem possible to have a negative number of jelly beans being too high or too low. Let's reevaluate the problem:

If Tim's guess was 202.5 jelly beans too low, this means the actual number of red jelly beans is actually 202.5 + 900 = 1102.5 jelly beans.

Now, if the true number of red jelly beans is 900, then Tim's guess was 1102.5 - 900 = 202.5 jelly beans too high.

So, Tim's guess was 202.5 jelly beans too high, not too low.

The correct interpretation of the question seems to be asking how far off his estimate was, not what the correct number of red jelly beans is. Therefore, the answer to the original question remains the same, with no need to calculate further. The jar contains 900 red jelly beans, while Tim estimated it to contain 1102.5 jelly beans. This means his guess was 202.5 jelly beans too high, which is reasonable considering the precision required for such a calculation. The answer is: $202.5$"

If the number of passengers on the bus doubled at the third station, this means there were 2 * 90 = 180 people on the bus.

Increase amount = Original price * Increase percentage = $2 * 150% = $2 * 1.5 = $3.

The new price after increasing by 150% becomes: $2 + $3 = $5 per visit.

Over these 5 years, she went to the museum 3 times a year. So, over those 5 years, she spent:

The total length of the board after the cut is the sum of the lengths of both pieces, which is \(x + 4x = 5x\).

We know that this total length is 40 feet (the original length of the board), so we set up the equation:

The discount is 20%, so the amount of the discount is:

\[ \text{Discount} = 20\% \times \$70 = 0.20 \times \$70 = \$14 \]

### Step 3: Subtract the discount from the original price to find the final cost after discount
Subtracting the discount from the original cost gives us:

\[ \text{Final Cost} = \$70 - \$14 = \$56 \]

### Step 4: Add the cost of the nail art
Karen wants to add nail art to her nails. Each finger requires 3 hours of work ($3 per hour), so for two fingers:

\[ \text{Total Nail Art Cost} = 2 \times 3 \times \$3 = \$18 \]

### Step 5: Calculate the total cost
Finally, add the cost of the nail art to the final cost to get the total:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$56 + \$18 = \$74 \]

Therefore, Karen would pay a total of $74 for both services including the cost of the nail art."

"If Samantha has 27 paintings, and she has 12 fewer paintings than Shelley, then we can find out how many paintings Shelley has by adding those 12 to Samantha's number of paintings.

\[ \text{Shelley's paintings} = \text{Samantha's paintings} + 12 = 27 + 12 = 39 \]

Now, if Shelley has 8 more paintings than Kim, we can find out how many paintings Kim has by subtracting 8 from Shelley's number of paintings.

\[ \text{Kim's paintings} = \text{Shelley's paintings} - 8 = 39 - 8 = 31 \]

Therefore, Kim has 31 paintings.

"To find out how far Michael travels over 3 days if his average speed is 50 kilometers per hour, we first calculate the total distance traveled.

Given:
- Distance from Alaska to Texas: 6000 km
- Average speed: 50 km/h

The time it takes to travel 6000 km at 50 km/h is calculated using the formula:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]

Substituting the given values:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{6000 \, \text{km}}{50 \, \text{km/h}} = 120 \, \text{hours} \]

Now, to find out how far Michael covers in one day (which is 24 hours), we divide the total time by 24:

\[ \text{Distance per day} = \frac{6000 \, \text{km}}{24 \, \text{hours}} = 250 \, \text{km/day} \]

Over 3 days, Michael would cover:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 250 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 750 \, \text{km} \]

Finally, to find the percentage of the distance covered, we use the formula:

\[ \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Covered}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substitute the values:

\[ \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{750 \, \text{km}}{6000 \, \text{km}} \right) \times 100 = 12.5\% \]

Therefore, Michael has covered approximately 12.5% of the distance between Alaska and Texas in 3 days.

"The custodian spends 900 minutes (8 hours x 60 minutes) cleaning all 80 classrooms over 5 days.

To find out how long they spend cleaning each day, we divide this number by 5:

Each classroom takes 15 minutes to clean, so to find out how many classrooms they can clean in a day:

\( 180 \div 15 = 12 \).

They can clean 12 classrooms in one day.

To find the percentage of their day spent cleaning classrooms, we take the number of classrooms cleaned divided by the total number of classrooms times 100:

"To calculate the number of telephone calls Jason needs to make to achieve his goal of selling 15 cars and earning his bonus, we can follow these steps:

1. First, determine the number of customers who will likely come to the dealership from the average of 25 phone calls made.
   Since for every 25 phone calls, Jason expects to get one customer, he needs \( \frac{1}{25} \) of the total calls to convert into actual customers.

2. Calculate the expected number of customers from the phone calls.
   Given that Jason needs to make 15 phone calls to achieve this goal, he expects \( 15 \times \frac{1}{25} = 0.6 \) or approximately 6 customers.

3. Next, figure out how many of those customers will actually purchase a car. For every two customers who come into the dealership, one will buy a car. So, with 6 customers coming, there would be \( \frac{6}{2} = 3 \) customers who will buy cars.

4. Finally, calculate the number of telephone calls needed to reach the goal.
   To sell 15 cars, Jason needs to call \( 15 \times 2 = 30 \) times (since each sale requires 2 phone calls).

Therefore, based on these calculations, Jason would need to make approximately 30 telephone calls to earn his bonus and sell 15 cars.

For the medium candles:

The other half of the rooms are 5 medium candles each, so that's 5/2 = 2.5 rooms

But we can't have half a room, so let's round down to 2 rooms because you can't have half a candle.

So, they use 2 medium candles because there are 5 medium candles per room and it's 2 rooms.

Adding them up, they use 2 (small) + 2 (medium) + 4 (flashlight) + 4 (small) + 5 (medium) = 19 candles and flashlights.

"John spends 5 minutes on the first side.

The second side takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes.

The third side also takes twice as long as the first side, so it takes \(5 \times 2 = 10\) minutes too.

For the last two sides, they each take half as long as the first side, meaning they take \(5 \div 2 = 2.5\) minutes each.

So, the time spent on the last two sides is \(2.5 \times 2 = 5\) minutes.

Adding up all these times gives us the total time to solve the Rubik's cube:

First side: \(5\) minutes
Second side: \(10\) minutes
Third side: \(10\) minutes
Last two sides (total): \(5 + 5 = 10\) minutes

"It usually takes 7 minutes for the paint to dry on one painting. With the new varnish, it takes 12 minutes.

If Louise paints 6 paintings with the new varnish, we can calculate the time taken as follows:

For 6 paintings:

- Time for all paintings at new drying rate (12 minutes): \(6 \times 12 = 72\) minutes

The difference between these two times gives us the extra time required:

Extra time = New drying rate time - Old drying rate time = \(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes

Therefore, it would take 30 additional minutes for the coats of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish to dry compared to the old ones.

The other half is in water, so he covers another \( \frac{1}{2} \times 200 = 100 \) yards in water.

On land, Phineas hops at a speed of 20 yards per minute, so it takes him \( \frac{100}{20} = 5 \) minutes to hop home.

In water, he swims at a speed of 10 yards per minute, so it takes him \( \frac{100}{10} = 10 \) minutes to swim home.

For one gallon of lemonade (which requires 1 cup of lemon juice), Tim uses 6 lemons. 

Therefore, for four gallons of lemonade:

Total lemons needed = \(4 \times 6\)

Calculating this gives us:

\(4 \times 6 = 24\) lemons

Allen requested an extra gallon of lemonade that is twice as tart as the others. This means it will require twice the amount of fresh lemon juice. So for the extra gallon:

Fresh lemon juice for the extra gallon = \(2 \times 6 = 12\) lemons

Adding the extra lemons for the extra gallon to the initial calculation:

Total lemons needed for the extra gallon = \(12\)

Now, adding the lemons needed for the original four gallons to the lemons for the extra gallon gives the total number of lemons Tim will need:

" In the first year, the boat depreciates by 30% of $9000. To find this amount, we multiply $9000 by 30%, or 0.30: $9000 \times 0.30 = $2700$. So after the first year, the boat is worth $9000 - $2700 = $6300.

In the second year, the boat again depreciates by 30% of its value at the end of the first year. We already know the boat is worth $6300 after the first year, so we calculate 30% of $6300: $6300 \times 0.30 = $1890. Therefore, after the second year, the boat is worth $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of its value at the end of the second year. We already know the boat is worth $4410 after the second year, so we calculate 20% of $4410: $4410 \times 0.20 = $882. Therefore, after the third year, the boat is worth $4410 - $882 = $3528.

Helen rode the bus 7 times, so the total cost of the bus trips is 7 * $8 = $56.
She stayed at the hotel for 3 nights, so the total cost of the hotel stay is 3 * $80 = $240.
To find out how much Helen paid for the hotel and bus travels during that trip, we add the cost of the hotel stay and the cost of the bus trips together: $240 + $56 = $296.
The answer is $\boxed{296}$."
"If Dallas had 21 marbles before dropping 4, then he initially had 21 + 4 = 25 marbles.

Since Mazie gave all her marbles to the twins, we can find out how many she gave to each by dividing the total number of marbles she had (52) by the number of twins (2).

"To calculate the amount of crepe paper needed, you multiply the length and width of the rectangle. The formula for the area of a rectangle is:

\[ \text{Area} = \text{Length} \times \text{Width} \]

Given that the rectangle measures 20 feet on the long side (which we'll call \(L\)) and 15 feet on the short side (which we'll call \(W\)), the area will be:

\[ \text{Area} = L \times W = 20 \times 15 \]

Calculating this gives us:

\[ \text{Area} = 300 \text{ square feet} \]

If each piece of crepe paper covers 1 square foot, then the number of pieces required would be equal to the area covered by one piece. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, and the area is in square feet, it doesn't matter if you're measuring in inches or square feet.

Therefore, the number of pieces of crepe paper James needs to purchase is 300 pieces.

However, the question asks for the total length of the crepe paper needed, not the number of pieces. Since each piece is 1 foot long, the total length of crepe paper needed is:

\[ \text{Total Length} = \text{Number of Pieces} \times \text{Length of Each Piece} \]
\[ \text{Total Length} = 300 \times 1 = 300 \text{ feet} \]

Thus, James needs 300 feet of crepe paper.

"To calculate the total amount of money the company receives for selling chocolate bars over two weeks, we first determine the daily sales revenue and then multiply that by the number of days in two weeks.

Given that the company produces 5000 bars in one day:

Daily Sales Revenue = Number of Bars × Price Per Bar
                            = 5000 bars × $2/bar
                            = $10,000/day

Now, let's calculate the earnings over two weeks (which typically have about 14 days):

Total Earnings Over Two Weeks = Daily Sales Revenue × Days in Two Weeks
                                      = $10,000/day × 14 days

For the jackfruit:
\[ \text{Cost of jackfruit} = 1.5 \times \$8/\text{pound} = \$12/\text{pound} \]

For the special honey:
\[ \text{Cost of special honey} = 2 \times \$10/\text{pound} = \$20/\text{pound} \]

The total cost to make one jar is the sum of these three ingredients:

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling one jar:
\[ \text{Revenue per jar} = \$50/\text{jar} \]

Next, we subtract the cost from the revenue to find the profit:
\[ \text{Profit per jar} = \text{Revenue per jar} - \text{Total cost per jar} \]
\[ \text{Profit per jar} = \$50 - \$44 = \$6/\text{jar} \]

Finally, to find the total profit from selling 10 jars:
\[ \text{Total profit} = \text{Profit per jar} \times \text{Number of jars} \]

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Igor collected 16 test tubes.
2. Igor collected 7 beakers.
3. Igor collected 14 Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor collected is given as 29.

We can set up an equation based on this information:

\[16 \text{ (test tubes)} + 7 \text{ (beakers)} + 14 \text{ (Petri dishes)} = 29\]

Simplifying this equation gives us:

\[37 = 29\]

However, this doesn't make sense because if we add up the numbers of test tubes, beakers, and Petri dishes, they don't equal 29. There seems to be a misunderstanding in the interpretation or calculation here.

Let's re-examine the problem statement carefully:

- The total number of items collected is 29.
- Igor collected 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes.
- Igor accidentally collected half as many test tubes as requested, so he actually collected \(16/2 = 8\) test tubes.
- Igor also collected 2 more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he actually collected \(14+2 = 16\) Petri dishes.

Adding these corrected values together, we get:

\[8 (\text{test tubes}) + 7 (\text{beakers}) + 16 (\text{Petri dishes}) = 31\]

This still doesn't match the total provided in the question, suggesting there might have been a miscommunication or a mix-up in the setup. Given the details presented, it appears there may be an issue with interpreting or calculating the quantities correctly. If you meant to say that Igor collected exactly 16 test tubes, 7 beakers, and 14 Petri dishes, then our calculations would align with what was originally stated. However, without additional context or clarification, it's not possible to determine the exact number of beakers Igor lost from the given information alone. We would need more specific details about how the discrepancy arises. 

Assuming the intent was to calculate the actual number of items Igor collected (which is 31), but the original count was intended to be 29, we could adjust the calculation accordingly.

"Let's calculate this problem step-by-step.

First, we know that Aaron runs each mile twice as fast as Vanessa. Since Vanessa ran 4 miles, Aaron ran \(4 \times 2 = 8\) miles.

Given that Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her 4 miles, we can find her speed (in miles per minute) by dividing the distance by time:

\[Speed_{Vanessa} = \frac{Distance}{Time} = \frac{4 \text{ miles}}{16 \text{ minutes}} = \frac{1}{4} \text{ miles/minute}\]

Now, we're told Vanessa runs twice as far as Aaron did. Since Aaron ran 8 miles, Vanessa ran \(8 \times 2 = 16\) miles.

To find out how long it took Vanessa to run her 16 miles at her speed, we use the formula:

\[Time_{Vanessa} = \frac{Distance}{Speed_{Vanessa}}\]

Substituting the known values:

\[Time_{Vanessa} = \frac{16 \text{ miles}}{\frac{1}{4} \text{ miles/minute}} = 16 \text{ miles} \times 4 \text{ minutes/mile} = 64 \text{ minutes}\]

Therefore, Vanessa took 64 minutes to complete her part of the race.

" Let's say there are $x$ chickens and $y$ cows on the farm.
Each chicken has 2 legs, so the total number of chicken legs is $2x$.
Each cow has 4 legs, so the total number of cow legs is $4y$.
The total number of animal legs is the sum of the chicken legs and the cow legs, so it's $2x + 4y$.
We know that the total number of animal legs is 70, so we can set up the equation $2x + 4y = 70$.
We also know that Farmer Brown has 20 animals in total, so we can say $x + y = 20$.
Now we have a system of two equations:
\begin{align*}
2x + 4y &= 70 \\
x + y &= 20
\end{align*}
To solve this system, we can multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ the same in both equations:
\begin{align*}
4x + 2y &= 40 \\
x + y &= 20
\end{align*}
Subtracting the second equation from the first gives $3x = 20$, so $x = \frac{20}{3}$. But the number of animals must be a whole number, so this doesn't work.
Let's try another approach. We know that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs, and the total number of legs is 70. So if we let $c$ represent the number of chickens and $b$ represent the number of cows, we can write the equation $2c + 4b = 70$.
We also know that $c + b = 20$ (the total number of animals).
Multiplying the second equation by 2 gives $2c + 2b = 40$, but we already have $2c + 4b = 70$, so we can subtract these two equations to get $2b = 30$, so $b = 15$.
Substituting $b = 15$ into the second equation gives $c + 15 = 20$, so $c = 5$.
Therefore, there are 5 chickens on the farm.
The answer is: $5$."
" They ordered 7 pizzas, and each pizza is cut into 8 slices, so there are a total of 7 * 8 = 56 slices.
Henry and his 3 friends make a total of 4 people who want to share the slices.
To find out how many slices each person can have, we divide the total number of slices by the number of people: 56 / 4 = 14.
Each person can have 14 slices.
