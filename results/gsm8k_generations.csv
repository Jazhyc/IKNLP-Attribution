" Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs left.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining eggs at $2 per egg, so she makes 9 * $2 = $18 every day.
The answer is $\boxed{18}$."
" It takes 2 bolts of blue fiber.
The amount of white fiber needed is half the amount of blue fiber, so it is 2/2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.
To find the total number of bolts needed, we add the number of blue bolts and the number of white bolts together.
So, the total number of bolts needed is 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3 bolts.
The answer is $\boxed{3}$."

"To find the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought, we first calculate the cost of each type of pastry individually and then sum them up.

For the donuts:
- Each dozen costs $68, so 3 dozens would cost \(3 \times 68 = \$204\).

For the mini cupcakes:
- Each dozen costs $80, so 2 dozens would cost \(2 \times 80 = \$160\).

For the mini cheesecakes:
- Each dozen costs $55, so 6 dozens would cost \(6 \times 55 = \$330\).

Now, adding these amounts together gives us the total cost:
\[204 + 160 + 330 = \$694.\]

Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries Toula bought is $694.

" Carlos needs to calculate the net income from selling lemons minus the annual expenses to determine when he starts making a profit.

The annual revenue from selling lemons is calculated by multiplying the number of lemons (7) by the price per lemon ($1.5), so the annual revenue is 7 * $1.5 = $10.5.

The annual expenses include the initial tree cost ($90) plus the yearly expenses ($3/year * 12 years = $36). So the total annual expenses are $90 + $36 = $126.

To find the net income per year, we subtract the annual expenses from the annual revenue: $10.5 - $126 = -$115. This means Carlos is losing $115 per year due to the expenses.

However, this calculation assumes that Carlos is starting with a loss and calculating his way back to profitability. To find when he starts making a profit, we need to reverse the process. We start with the initial investment ($90) and work backwards to see when he breaks even or makes a profit.

Let's denote the number of years needed to break even as \(x\). The equation representing the situation is:

\[90 - 115x = 0\]

Solving for \(x\) gives us:

\[115x = 90\]
\[x = \frac{90}{115}\]

Calculating this gives us approximately 0.77 years. Since Carlos cannot have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number because he needs to start earning money at some point.

Therefore, it will take Carlos 1 year before he starts earning money on the lemon tree.

"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \(V\).

From the information given:

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, so she had \(V - \frac{V}{3} = \frac{2V}{3}\) left.
2. Then she sold 2 more to the red house, making it \(\frac{2V}{3} - 2\) vacuum cleaners.
3. After selling to the orange house, she had half of what was left, which equals 5 vacuum cleaners.

So, we have the equation:
\[ \frac{2V}{3} - 2 = \frac{5}{2} \]

To solve this equation, first multiply all terms by 6 (the least common multiple of 3 and 2):
\[ 4V - 12 = 15 \]

Then add 12 to both sides:
\[ 4V = 27 \]

Finally, divide by 4:
\[ V = \frac{27}{4} = 6.75 \]

Therefore, Melanie started with 6.75 vacuum cleaners, but since she can't start with a fraction of a product, we round up to the nearest whole number because you can't sell a fraction of a vacuum cleaner. So, Melanie started with 7 vacuum cleaners.

"To find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance and then subtract this from the total number of students.

Total students = 20
Percentage of students enrolled in contemporary dance = 20%

Number of students enrolled in contemporary dance = \(20 \times 20\% = 20 \times 0.2 = 4\) students

Remaining students after accounting for contemporary dance = Total students - Contemporary dance students = \(20 - 4 = 16\) students

Now, let's find the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:

Percentage of remaining students enrolled in jazz dance = 25%

Number of students enrolled in jazz dance = \(16 \times 25\% = 16 \times 0.25 = 4\) students

Finally, let's find the number of students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

The rest of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance = Total students - (Contemporary dance students + Jazz dance students)

Hip-hop dance students = Total students - (Contemporary dance students + Jazz dance students) = \(20 - 4 - 4 = 12\) students

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

Hip-hop dance students = 12
Total students = 20

Percentage of hip-hop dance students = \(\frac{Hip-hop dance students}{Total students} \times 100\% = \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 60\%\)

Therefore, 60% of the entire students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

For the electronics:
\[ \text{Increase} = \$8,000 \times 1.2\% = \$8,000 \times 0.012 = \$96 \]

The merchant decides to choose the jewelry because it offers a higher percentage increase in value compared to the electronics. Therefore, the merchant would choose the jewelry with a potential profit of:

\[ \text{Profit from Jewelry} = \$5,000 + \$125 = \$5,125 \]

" Marissa has already walked 4 + 2 = 6 miles.
She still needs to walk 12 - 6 = 6 miles.
Her goal is to have an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile hike.

The total time spent walking so far is 1 + 1 = 2 hours.
To achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles, the total time must be 12 * 4 = 48 hours.
Therefore, the time left to walk the remaining 6 miles is 48 - 2 = 46 hours.
To find the speed required to cover the remaining 6 miles in 46 hours, we divide the distance by the time: 6 / 46 = 0.13 miles per hour.

"Let's denote the price of the boots as \(B\) dollars.

According to the problem:

- The second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, so it costs \(2 \times \$33 = \$66\).
- Together, these two pairs of high heels cost $5 less than the boots, meaning they cost \(B - \$5\).

The total cost of the boots and the high heels combined is given as $62 (since the total cost of the boots and the high heels is $62). Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[B + (\$33 + \$66) = \$62\]

Simplifying this gives us:

\[B + \$99 = \$62\]

Subtracting $99 from both sides to solve for \(B\) gives us:

\[B = \$62 - \$99\]
\[B = -$37

However, prices cannot be negative, indicating there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the interpretation of the question. Let's re-evaluate the information provided:

Given that the second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair ($33), and the total cost of the boots and the high heels combined is $62, let's correct our approach.

If the second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, then the first pair must cost $33 / 2 = $16.50.

Now, if the total cost of the boots and the high heels combined is $62, and we know the first pair costs $16.50, then the second pair must also cost $62 - $16.50 = $45.50.

Therefore, the boots cost $16.50, and the high heels cost $45.50. To find the total number of dollars spent on shoes, we add the cost of the boots and the high heels:

Total cost = $16.50 + $45.50 = $62

Thus, the boots cost $16.50, and the high heels cost $45.50, making the total cost of the shoes $62. This matches the original calculation without any mistakes made in interpreting the question.

The third friend says 25% more than the first one. This means the third friend thinks there are $80 + 0.25 \times 80 = 80 + 20 = 100$ jelly beans.

To find the average guess, we add up the guesses and divide by the number of friends. Gunter asked two friends for their guesses, so there are 2 friends. The sum of the guesses is $80 + 60 + 100 = 240$. Dividing this by 2 gives us an average guess of $\frac{240}{2} = 120$.

"To solve this problem, we first determine Dana's running speed and then calculate the distance she covers during the given time periods.

Given:
- Running speed = 4x (four times faster than walking)
- Walking speed = 1x (half as fast as running)

We know that skipping takes 3 miles per hour.

Let's denote:
- The distance covered while running as \(R\) miles,
- The distance covered while walking as \(W\) miles.

From the information provided:

1. Running speed = 4x miles/hour
2. Walking speed = 1x miles/hour
3. Skipping speed = 3 miles/hour

The total distance covered in 6 hours is the sum of distances covered while running, walking, and skipping.

First, let's find the speeds in terms of x:

- Running speed = 4x miles/hour
- Walking speed = 1x miles/hour
- Skipping speed = 3 miles/hour

Now, let's calculate the distances covered under each condition:

### Running:
- Distance covered = Speed Ã— Time = \(4x \times \frac{6}{3} = 8x\) miles

### Walking:
- Distance covered = Speed Ã— Time = \(1x \times \frac{6}{3} = 2x\) miles

### Skipping:
- Distance covered = Speed Ã— Time = \(3 \times \frac{6}{3} = 6\) miles

Adding these distances together gives us the total distance covered in 6 hours:
\[Total\ Distance = 8x + 2x + 6 = 10x + 6\]

Substituting \(x\) with the value from the original question (\(x = 1\)) gives us the final result:
\[Total\ Distance = 10(1) + 6 = 16\] miles

Therefore, Dana can travel 16 miles in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking.

If your daily calorie target is 2000 and you have already consumed 1800 calories, this means you still have 2000-1800 = 200 calories left.

Therefore, if you consume 15000 calories from the bag of chips, you can still consume 200/15000 = 0.013333333333333333 of your daily calorie target.

This means you can still consume 0.013333333333333333*2000 = 26.666666666666668 calories.

However, since you cannot consume a fraction of a gram, you can only consume up to 26 grams of the bag of chips.

"To find out how many kittens the Doubtfire sisters have after adopting 7 kittens and receiving 12 more from their mother, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of kittens Patchy has**: Since Patchy has had thrice the number of adopted kittens as the first cat (which is 7), we multiply 7 by 3.

   \[ \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 7 \times 3 = 21 \]

2. **Add the kittens from Patchy to the initial 7 kittens**: Now, add the kittens from Patchy to the 7 kittens they already have.

"For the first 20 years, Marcy receives a pension of $50,000 per year.

The amount of her pension increases by 5% each subsequent year from the age of 21 until she retires at 30 years old.

Let's calculate the increase in her pension over these years:

- For the first 20 years (ages 21 to 30), the increase is 5% of $50,000 per year.
- The formula for calculating this increase is: \(5\%\times$50,000 = $2,500\) per year.

Over those 20 years, the total increase in her pension would be: \(20 \times $2,500 = $50,000\).

Adding this to her initial pension of $50,000 per year for the next 10 years (from ages 31 to 40):

- Total pension for the last 10 years: $50,000 per year for 10 years = $500,000.

Adding this to her original pension gives us the final annual pension:

- Final annual pension: $50,000 (initial) + $500,000 (last 10 years) = $550,000.

Therefore, Marcy's final annual pension after 30 years is $550,000.

"To calculate the total amount Artie will make from selling all the flowers, we first need to determine the price of each type of flower rounded to the nearest dollar.

For marigolds:
- Each pot sells for $2.74, but since it's not possible to sell fractions of a dollar, we'll round this to the nearest whole number. So, $2.74 rounds up to $3.00 per pot.

For petunias:
- Each pot sells for $1.87, rounding to the nearest dollar gives us $2.00 per pot.

For begonias:
- Each pot sells for $2.12, rounding to the nearest dollar gives us $2.00 per pot.

Now, let's calculate the total sales for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: \(12 \times \$3.00 = \$36.00\)
- Petunias: \(9 \times \$2.00 = \$18.00\)
- Begonias: \(17 \times \$2.00 = \$34.00\)

Adding these amounts together gives us the total sales:

Total Sales = \$36.00 (from marigolds) + \$18.00 (from petunias) + \$34.00 (from begonias) = \$88.00

Therefore, Artie will make a total of $88.00 from selling all the flowers.

Given that one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed for the first year is:

"To find out how much laundry Raymond does, we first determine how much laundry David does based on the information given:

Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, so if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, David does \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

Now, let's find out how much laundry Raymond does. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, Raymond does \( \frac{1}{2} \times 400 = 200 \) pounds of laundry.

Finally, to find the difference between the amount of laundry Raymond and David do, we subtract the amount of laundry David does from the amount of laundry Raymond does:

\( 200 - 100 = 100 \)

Therefore, Raymond does 100 pounds of laundry, while David does 100 pounds of laundry. The difference in the amount of laundry they both do is 0 pounds (since they do the same amount). However, this doesn't make sense in the context provided, indicating there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. Let's re-evaluate the calculation:

Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, but Sarah does four times as much laundry as David. This implies that the ratio of their laundry loads is not directly proportional to the number of times they wash clothes. Instead, it seems like the problem intended to compare the ratios of their laundry loads rather than the actual amounts. 

Given the original setup, if Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, and she does 4 times as much laundry as David, then David would do \( \frac{400}{4} = 100 \) pounds of laundry. 

However, if we're looking at the difference in the amount of laundry they do, considering the direct proportionality between the number of times they wash clothes, the correct approach would be to compare the ratios of their laundry loads, not the absolute numbers. 

Let's reconsider the comparison of the ratios:

- Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David.
- Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah.

The ratio of the amount of laundry Raymond does to the amount of laundry David does is \( \frac{1}{4} \), meaning for every 1 pound of laundry David does, Raymond does \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of laundry. 

To find the difference in the amount of laundry they do, we can use the ratio of their laundry loads:

- For every 1 pound of laundry David does, Raymond does \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of laundry.
- Therefore, for every 1 pound of laundry David does, Raymond does \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound of laundry.

Since Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry, the amount of laundry Raymond does is \( \frac{1}{4} \) of that, which is \( \frac{1}{4} \times 400 = 100 \) pounds of laundry.

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry Raymond and David do is 0 pounds, because they both do the same amount of laundry when compared using the correct ratio of their laundry loads. However, the original interpretation of comparing the absolute numbers of laundry loads may have led to a misunderstanding."
"To find out how much Vincent saves by buying flowers at the better price, we first calculate the cost of each type of package.

- The cost per flower is $2.50 / 3 = $0.833 (rounded to two decimal places).

For the package of 2 flowers costing $1:

- The cost per flower is $1 / 2 = $0.50.

Now, let's compare the cost per flower for both types of packages:

- For the package of 2 flowers, the cost per flower is $0.50.

The difference in cost per flower between the two packages is $0.833 - $0.50 = $0.333.

Given that Vincent wants to buy 18 flowers, the amount saved by choosing the better price would be:

- Number of packages needed with the cheaper price: 18 / 2 = 9 packages.

"If Lee ran the 400 meters in 38 seconds, and he used to run 2 seconds faster than Gerald, this means that Gerald normally takes 38+2 = 40 seconds to run the same distance.

However, Gerald's speed got boosted by 10% due to his new diet. To find out how long it now takes him, we calculate 110% of 40 seconds (since 10% is already accounted for).

To do this calculation, we multiply 40 seconds by 110/100:

\[40 \times \frac{110}{100} = 44\]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 44 seconds.

" The number of cats is two times the number of dogs, so there are \(2 \times 60 = 120\) cats.

The combined number of pet dogs and cats is \(60 + 120 = 180\).

If the number of rabbits pets is twelve less than this combined number, then the number of rabbits pets is \(180 - 12 = 168\).

To find the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we add the number of dogs, cats, and rabbits together: \(60 + 120 + 168 = 348\).

"To find out how many girls are in the Girl Scout program, we first calculate the number of boys and then subtract it from the total number of students.

Given:
- Total number of students = 200
- Boys = \( \frac{2}{5} \) of 200
- Girls = \( \frac{3}{5} \) of 200 (since there are 200 students in total)

First, let's calculate the number of boys:

\[ \text{Boys} = \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \]

Next, let's calculate the number of girls:

\[ \text{Girls} = \frac{3}{5} \times 200 = 120 \]

Now, to find out how many girls are not in the Girl Scout program, we subtract the number of girls who are in the Girl Scout program from the total number of girls:

\[ \text{Girls not in the Girl Scout} = \text{Total Girls} - \text{Girls in the Girl Scout} \]
\[ \text{Girls not in the Girl Scout} = 120 - 80 = 40 \]

Therefore, 40 girls are not in the Girl Scout program.

"The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.

The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend. Since Jerome's first friend pressed 20 times, the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4)*20 = 20 + 5 = 25 times.

The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed 60 times, the third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.

Adding all these together gives us the total number of doorbell rings made:

20 (first friend) + 25 (second friend) + 60 (fourth friend) + 70 (third friend) = 195 doorbell rings.

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first calculate the distance covered by the fog bank in one minute.

Given that the fog bank covers 3 miles every 10 minutes, we can set up a proportion to find out how far it would cover in one minute:

\[ \frac{3\text{ miles}}{10\text{ minutes}} = \frac{x\text{ miles}}{1\text{ minute}} \]

Solving for \(x\) gives us:

\[ x = \frac{3}{10} \times 1 = \frac{3}{10} \text{ miles} \]

Now, knowing the city is 42 miles wide, we can find out how long it will take to cover the entire city by dividing the total width by the distance covered in one minute:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Total Width}}{\text{Distance Covered in One Minute}} = \frac{42\text{ miles}}{\frac{3}{10}\text{ miles/minute}} = 42 \times \frac{10}{3} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

" Frankie watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night from Monday to Tuesday, so that's 2 nights * 1 hour/night = 2 hours.
He also watched a 30-minute show on Wednesday, so that's 30 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.5 hours.
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, so that's 1 hour + 0.5 hours = 1.5 hours.
On Friday, he watched two 1-hour episodes, so that's 2 hours.
In total, he watched 2 hours (Monday to Tuesday) + 0.5 hours (Wednesday) + 1.5 hours (Thursday) + 2 hours (Friday) = 5 hours.
If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, then on Wednesday he must have watched 7 hours - 5 hours = 2 hours worth of shows.
Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours long, we can divide the number of hours he watched on Wednesday by 0.5 to find out how many 30-minute episodes he watched.
So, 2 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 4 episodes.
Therefore, Frankie watched 4 episodes of 30-minute shows on Wednesday.

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry made last year as \(x\). According to the problem:

1. This year, he plans to make twice as many cookies as he did last year, so this year he makes \(2x\) cookies.
2. However, he accidentally bakes 15 more cookies than intended, so this year he actually makes \(2x + 15\) cookies.

Given that after dropping 5 cookies, he ends up with 110 cookies, we can set up the equation:

\[2x + 15 - 5 = 110\]

Simplifying the equation gives us:

\[2x + 10 = 110\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides gives:

\[2x = 100\]

Dividing both sides by 2 gives:

\[x = 50\]

Therefore, Henry made 50 cookies last year.

"To find out how much water Julia's boat had taken on, we first need to calculate the rate at which water is being added to the boat.

Given that it takes Julia 16 seconds to row 20 feet, we can determine the rate of water addition per foot:

\[ \text{Rate} = \frac{\text{Time}}{\text{Distance}} = \frac{16}{20} = 0.8 \text{ liters per foot} \]

Now, if the boat is taking on water at this rate, we can calculate the amount of water added over the distance from the start (which is 64 seconds) using the formula:

\[ \text{Amount of Water} = \text{Rate} \times \text{Distance} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Amount of Water} = 0.8 \times 64 = 51.2 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, Julia's boat had taken on 51.2 liters of water by the time she reached the shore.

**Note:** This calculation assumes that the water level increases linearly with the distance traveled. However, given the context of the problem, it seems there might be a misunderstanding or additional information needed to provide a precise answer. For example, if the boat is not moving at all during the time it takes to reach the shore, the rate would be higher than what we calculated here."

"If Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold \( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \) photographs.

The maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. So, if we let \( B \) represent the number of birds in Jamal's photo, then \( B = 300 \times 50 \).

Therefore, \( B = 15000 \).

To find out how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo, we divide the number of photographs in his phone by the number of photographs in Brittany's phone:

\( \text{Number of ducks} = \frac{\text{Total photographs in Jamal's phone}}{\text{Photographs in Brittany's phone}} = \frac{1800}{300} = 6 \).

"If Adrien's salary four years ago was $40000, and it increased by 40%, we can find his current salary by multiplying this amount by 1 plus the percentage increase (which is 40%). So, his current salary is:

\[ \$40000 \times (1 + 0.40) = \$40000 \times 1.40 = \$56000 \]

Now, if Adrien's salary four years ago was 30% higher than Lylah's, let's denote Lylah's salary four years ago as \(L\). Then, Adrien's salary four years ago was \(1.30L\), and since we know \(1.30L = \$40000\), we can solve for \(L\) to find Lylah's salary:

\[ 1.30L = \$40000 \]
\[ L = \frac{\$40000}{1.30} \]
\[ L = \$30769.58 \] (approximately)

To find the total salary they were receiving four years later, we add Adrien's current salary to Lylah's salary four years ago:

\[ \$56000 + \$30769.58 = \$86769.58 \]

Therefore, the total salary the two were receiving four years later is approximately $86769.58.

"Let's denote the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began as \(x\). According to the problem, Jennie has a pile of 60 letters needing stamps, and a pile of letters already stamped with 30 letters.

The number of letters needing stamps is one-third of the total number of letters, so we can express this as \(\frac{1}{3}x\).

Given that Jennie puts stamps on one-third of these letters, the number of letters she stamps is \(\frac{1}{3}\) times the number of letters needing stamps, which equals \(\frac{1}{3} \times \frac{1}{3}x = \frac{x}{9}\).

We know that after putting stamps on these letters, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means that before putting stamps on any letters, there were \(30 + \frac{x}{9}\) letters in the pile.

Therefore, the equation representing the situation before putting stamps on any letters is:

\[30 + \frac{x}{9} = x\]

To solve for \(x\), we first subtract \(\frac{x}{9}\) from both sides of the equation:

\[30 = x - \frac{x}{9}\]

Multiplying through by 9 to clear the fraction gives us:

\[270 = 9x - x\]

Simplifying further:

\[270 = 8x\]

Dividing both sides by 8 yields:

\[x = \frac{270}{8} = 33.75\]

However, since the number of letters must be a whole number (you can't have a fraction of a letter), it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a rounding error in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate our steps carefully.

After correcting the division by 8, we get:

\[x = \frac{270}{8} = 33.75\]

But again, we cannot have a fraction of a letter, indicating there might have been a mistake in the initial setup or understanding of the question. The correct approach would involve recognizing that the number of letters needing stamps is one-third of the total, not two-thirds. 

If we assume the original statement meant ""one-third of the letters needing stamps"" instead of ""two-thirds"", then the correct interpretation would be:

One-third of the letters needing stamps is \(\frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20\) letters.

Then, the number of letters in the pile when Jennie began would be \(20 + 30 = 50\) letters.

Thus, if the original statement was intended to mean one-third of the letters needing stamps, the correct calculation would be:

\[50\] letters in the pile when Jennie began."

2. Worker bees are twice as many as baby bees, so \(W = 2B\).
3. Baby bees are twice as many as queen bees, so \(B = 2Q\).

Substituting the second equation into the first gives us \(2B + B + Q = 700\). Simplifying this gives us \(3B + Q = 700\).

Now, substituting the third equation into this gives us \(3(2Q) + Q = 700\), which simplifies to \(6Q + Q = 700\), or \(7Q = 700\).

Solving for \(Q\) gives us \(Q = \frac{700}{7} = 100\).

Now, using the third equation with \(Q = 100\), we can find \(B\): \(B = 2Q = 2(100) = 200\).

" Kim has 3 current clients and 5 potential clients, so he has a total of 3 + 5 = 8 clients.
Each client needs 2 bottles of bleach and a pack of cloths, so he will need a total of 2 * 8 = 16 bottles of bleach and 5 * 8 = 40 packs of cloths.
The cost of the bleach is $2 per bottle, so the total cost of the bleach is 16 * $2 = $32.
The cost of the cloths is $5 per pack, so the total cost of the cloths is 40 * $5 = $200.
Adding these two amounts together, the total expenses are $32 + $200 = $232.
If Kim's total income is $92, then his profit is $92 - $232 = -$140.
However, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the calculation. The profit should not be negative. Let's reevaluate the problem.

Kim calculates that his total income each week will be $92. This includes both the income from his existing clients (3) and the additional income from the potential clients (5). So, the total income is $92.

He also calculates that his expenses are $232. This includes the cost of the bleach ($32) and the cost of the cloths ($200).

Next, we need to find out how many times a year John can harvest his pineapples. Since he can harvest them every 3 months, the number of times a year is 12 / 3 = 4.

Finally, to find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we multiply the total number of pineapples by the number of times a year. So, John can harvest 1000 * 4 = 4000 pineapples within a year.

"To find out when the winner will finish the race, we first calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their destination.

For Steve:
Distance = 3 miles
Speed = 440 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed = 3 miles / 440 ft/min = 0.0694 minutes

For Tim:
Distance = 2 miles
Speed = 264 feet per minute

Time = Distance / Speed = 2 miles / 264 ft/min = 0.0075 minutes

Now, let's compare the times:

Steve's time = 0.0694 minutes
Tim's time = 0.0075 minutes

The difference in time between Steve and Tim is:
Difference = Tim's time - Steve's time = 0.0075 minutes - 0.0694 minutes = -0.0619 minutes

Since the result is negative, this means Tim is faster than Steve. Therefore, the winner will finish the race before Steve, and the winner will have waited for Steve to finish the race.

The winner will wait for Steve to finish the race for 0.0619 minutes (or about 0.0619/60 hours or 0.00103 hours).

Therefore, the winner will be waiting at their house for approximately 0.00103 hours before the loser finishes the race.

"Let's break this problem down into steps:

1. **Dave ate fourteen french fries before the seagull took them**.
2. **The seagull ate half the amount Dave ate**, so it ate \( \frac{1}{2} \times 14 = 7 \) french fries.
3. **After the seagull ate, there were \( 14 - 7 = 7 \) french fries left**.
4. **Three pigeons ate three fries each**, so they ate \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) french fries.
5. **After the pigeons ate, there were \( 7 - 9 = -2 \) french fries left**, but we can't have negative fries, so let's assume the pigeons ate all their fries and there were no fries left.

However, we know that after the pigeons ate, there were five french fries left. This means that the raccoon must have eaten two-thirds of the remaining fries. Let's calculate how many fries that would be:

\[ \text{Fries eaten by the raccoon} = \frac{2}{3} \times 7 = \frac{14}{3} \approx 4.67 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a fry, we'll round this number to the nearest whole number, which gives us approximately 5 fries eaten by the raccoon.

Now, let's add up all the fries eaten:

- Dave ate 14 fries.
- The seagull ate 7 fries.
- The pigeons ate 9 fries.
- The raccoon ate 5 fries.

Adding these together gives us \( 14 + 7 + 9 + 5 = 35 \) fries eaten.

Starting with the original 7 fries, subtracting the fries eaten gives us \( 7 - 35 = -28 \), indicating that there were not enough fries left to account for the 35 fries eaten.

Therefore, the initial count of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was likely incorrect because the scenario described doesn't allow for a situation where the raccoon could eat all the remaining fries without any being left over. It seems there might be a misunderstanding or a gap in the information provided. Based on the given scenario, it appears there may be a mistake in the calculation or interpretation of the events leading up to the raccoon eating two-thirds of the remaining fries. Without further context or clarification, it's impossible to accurately determine the initial number of fries in the pack."
" On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, with each class lasting 1 hour. So on these days, he spends 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day at class.

He repeats this schedule from Monday to Friday, so in one week (which has 3 days), he spends 3 * 3 = 9 hours at class.

On Tuesdays and Thursdays, he has 2 classes each day, with each class lasting 2 hours. So on these days, he spends 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day at class.

Again, he repeats this schedule from Tuesday to Thursday, so in one week (which also has 2 days), he spends 2 * 4 = 8 hours at class.

Adding up the hours spent at class over the entire week gives us 9 + 8 = 17 hours.

Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending classes in a semester is 17 * 16 = 272 hours.

"To find the length of all the baked goods combined, we first convert everything into consistent units:

- The rolls are 4 inches long, so if there are 300 rolls, their total length would be \(300 \times 4\) inches.

- The croissants are 6 inches long, so if there are 120 croissants, their total length would be \(120 \times 6\) inches.

- The baguettes are 2 feet long, but since there are 12 inches in a foot, this means each baguette is \(2 \times 12\) inches long.

Now let's calculate the total length:

Rolls' total length = \(300 \times 4 = 1200\) inches
Croissants' total length = \(120 \times 6 = 720\) inches
Baguettes' total length = \(60 \times 12 = 720\) inches

Adding these together gives us the total length in inches:

Total length = \(1200 + 720 + 720 = 2640\) inches

Finally, converting the total length from inches to feet (since there are 12 inches in a foot):

\[2640 \text{ inches} = 2640 \div 12 = 220\] feet

Therefore, the entire batch of baked goods, when laid end-to-end, would be 220 feet long.

"To calculate the number of bananas needed to feed all the apes for 2 months, we first determine the monthly requirement for each species:

- Bananas required for apes (all three) = 200 bananas/month
- Bananas required for gorillas = 400 bananas/month
- Bananas required for baboons = 100 bananas/month

Adding these together gives us the total monthly requirement:

\[ \text{Total Monthly Requirement} = 200 + 400 + 100 = 700 \text{ bananas/month} \]

For 2 months, we multiply this monthly requirement by 2:

\[ \text{Bananas Required for 2 Months} = 700 \times 2 = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months.

**Note:** The question seems to have a typo or misunderstanding about the requirements for the apes. It states ""bananas every month"" but then asks for bananas for 2 months. Assuming the intention was to ask for the total amount of bananas needed over 2 months, the calculation above assumes the same monthly requirement for all species."

And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, so he caught \(3 + 2 = 5\) clownfish.

To find the total number of fish they caught together, we add up all their individual catches:

"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months with a 20% increase every two months, we can break it down into steps:

1. **Initial Cost**: The initial cost of the bag of marbles is $20.

2. **First Increase**: After the first two months (which is 2 periods), the price will increase by 20%. So, the increase is \(20\% \times \$20 = \$4\) or $4. Therefore, the new cost after the first increase is \(20 + 4 = \$24\).

3. **Second Increase**: After another two months (another period), the price again increases by 20%, so the increase is \(20\% \times \$24 = \$4.80\) or $4.80. Thus, the new cost after the second increase is \(24 + 4.80 = \$28.80\).

4. **Third Increase**: After another two months, the price increases by another 20%, making the increase \(20\% \times \$28.80 = \$5.76\) or $5.76. This brings us to \(28.80 + 5.76 = \$34.56\).

5. **Fourth Increase**: Another two months later, the price increases by another 20%, resulting in an increase of \(20\% \times \$34.56 = \$6.912\) or approximately $6.91. This brings our total to \(34.56 + 6.91 = \$41.47\).

Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost approximately $41.47.

" Let's say Brooke's current age is $x$. Then Seth's current age is $2x$ because Seth is twice as old as Brooke.

In two years, Brooke's age will be $x+2$, and Seth's age will be $2x+2$ because we add 2 to both Seth's and Brooke's current ages.

According to the problem, the sum of their ages in two years will be 28, so we can set up the equation $(x+2) + (2x+2) = 28$.

Combining like terms gives $3x + 4 = 28$.

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives $3x = 24$.

Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 8$.

So Brooke is currently 8 years old. To find Seth's age, we substitute $x = 8$ into $2x$ to get $2(8) = 16$.

Therefore, Seth is currently 16 years old.

Next, we multiply this time by the number of potatoes to find the total time spent on peeling:

\[ \text{Total time peeling} = \text{Time per potato} \times \text{Number of potatoes} = 0.025 \times 60 = 1.5 \text{ minutes or } 90 \text{ seconds} \]

Now, let's calculate the time spent on cutting each potato:

\[ \text{Time per potato} = \frac{\text{Time to cut}}{\text{Number of potatoes}} = \frac{5}{60} = 0.0833 \text{ minutes or } 5 \text{ seconds} \]

Finally, we add the time spent on peeling and cutting to find the total time spent preparing the potatoes:

"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue from selling lemonade.

Each gallon makes them $0.50/glass \times 20 glasses/gallon = $10/gallon.

They made $25 in profit, so their total revenue must have been $25 (profit) plus $25 (costs). This gives us:

Total Revenue = Profit + Costs = $25 + $25 = $50.

Now, let's figure out how much they spent on lemons. Since each gallon costs $3 for lemons and they made $50 in total, we can divide the total cost by the cost per gallon to find out how many gallons they made:

Gallons Made = Total Cost / Cost Per Gallon = $50 / $3/gallon = 16.666... gallons.

However, since they can't make a fraction of a gallon, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because they can't make part of a gallon. So, they made 16 gallons of lemonade.

The cost of lemons for each gallon is $3, so the total cost for lemons is:

Bo (40) + Monic (36) + Rani (46) = \(40 + 36 + 46 = 122\).

Therefore, the three have a total of 122 crabs together.

" Lloyd earned $10 an hour for both weeks.

For the first week, he worked 5 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned 5 * $10 = $50.

For the second week, he worked 8 hours at $10 per hour, so he earned 8 * $10 = $80.

To find out how much he earned for the first two weeks, we add the earnings from the first and second week together. So, $50 + $80 = $130.

Therefore, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks.

"If the winner got 3/4 of the votes and there were 80 students who voted, we can find out how many votes the winner received first.

The total votes received by the winner = \( \frac{3}{4} \times 80 \)

To find this, multiply 80 by 3/4:

\( \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \) votes

Now, if the total number of votes cast was 80, and the winner received 60 votes, the loser must have received the rest of the votes. To find out how many votes the loser got, subtract the number of votes the winner received from the total number of votes:

\( 80 - 60 = 20 \) votes

Therefore, the loser got 20 votes."
"Let's denote the number of white carnations as \(W\). According to the problem:

1. Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \(4W\).
2. Sandra ordered 200 pink calla lilies, which were five times the number of white carnations, meaning \(200 = 5W\), so \(W = \frac{200}{5} = 40\) white carnations.

Now we know Sandra originally ordered 40 white carnations. Since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses is \(4 \times 40 = 160\).

Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to keep Sandra's business happy.

" Let's say Mark's current age is $M$ and Jean's current age is $J$.

From the problem, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, so we can write this as an equation: $J = M + 2$.

We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age at that time. At that time, Jean's age would have been $J - 2$, and Mark's age would have been $M - 2$. So we can write this as another equation: $(J - 2) - 5 = \frac{1}{2}(J - 2)$.

Let's solve these equations step by step:

First, let's simplify the second equation: $J - 2 - 5 = \frac{1}{2}J - 2$.

Simplify further: $J - 7 = \frac{1}{2}J - 2$.

Next, let's isolate $J$ on one side of the equation. We can do this by adding $2$ to both sides: $J - 7 + 2 = \frac{1}{2}J - 2 + 2$.

This simplifies to: $J - 5 = \frac{1}{2}J$.

To get rid of the fraction, we multiply both sides of the equation by $2$: $2(J - 5) = J$.

This simplifies to: $2J - 10 = J$.

Subtracting $J$ from both sides gives us: $J - 10 = 0$.

Adding $10$ to both sides gives us: $J = 10$.

So Jean is currently $10$ years old.

"To determine how fast the faster team wins by, we'll calculate the time taken by each team's runners.

The fastest team (the well-rounded team) runs its 400-meter leg in 55 seconds.

For the second team, let's denote the speed of the second runner as \(S_2\). Since the second runner is 3 seconds faster than the first runner, we have:

\[S_2 = S_1 - 3\]

Given that the first runner takes 60 seconds, we can substitute \(S_1\) with 60:

\[S_2 = 60 - 3 = 57 \text{ seconds}\]

Now, let's find the time taken by the third runner. We know the third runner is 3 seconds faster than the second runner, so:

\[S_3 = S_2 - 3 = 57 - 3 = 54 \text{ seconds}\]

Finally, the fourth runner is 3 seconds faster than the third runner, so:

\[S_4 = S_3 - 3 = 54 - 3 = 51 \text{ seconds}\]

Adding up all these times gives us the total time taken by the second team:

Total time for the second team = \(55 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 229 \text{ seconds}\)

Therefore, the faster team wins by 229 seconds over the slower team.

"To find this probability, we can calculate the probabilities of Jerry rolling a number greater than 3 or two even numbers in a row.

### Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3:

The numbers greater than 3 on a standard six-sided die are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes, so the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \( \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \).

### Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row:

If Jerry rolls two even numbers in a row, he must roll a 2 first, followed by any one of the other four numbers. The probability of rolling a 2 is \( \frac{1}{6} \), and after that, there are 4 choices for the second number. So, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is \( \frac{1}{6} \times 4 = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{2}{3} \).

### Calculating the Difference:

Now, let's subtract the probability of rolling two even numbers from the probability of rolling a number greater than 3:

\[ \text{Difference} = \left( \frac{1}{2} - \frac{2}{3} \right) \]

To subtract these fractions, we need a common denominator, which is 6 in this case:

\[ \text{Difference} = \frac{3}{6} - \frac{4}{6} = \frac{-1}{6} \]

Converting this difference into a percentage gives us:

\[ \text{Percentage} = \left( \frac{-1}{6} \right) \times 100\% = -\frac{100}{6}\% = -16.\overline{6}\%\]

However, probabilities cannot be negative, so we take the absolute value to get the correct interpretation:

\[ \text{Absolute Value} = |-16.\overline{6}\%| = 16.67\% \]

Therefore, it is 16.67% more likely that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 than that he rolls two even numbers in a row."
"If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, then Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

"If there were 160 pieces of straw distributed among the rodents, and each rat received 6 pieces, then the number of rats is:

\[ \frac{160}{6} = 26.\overline{6} \]

However, since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't have part of a rat.

Therefore, there are \(26\) rats in total.

Given that there are 10 cages of hamsters with 5 pieces of straw each, let's calculate the total amount of straw used for the hamsters:

\[ 10 \times 5 = 50 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

The rabbits receive 20 pieces of straw, so together they use:

\[ 50 + 20 = 70 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

We know that all the straw from the rodents (160 pieces) plus the straw from the rabbits (70 pieces) equals the total amount of straw used:

\[ 160 + 70 = 230 \text{ pieces of straw} \]

To find out how many pieces of straw are left after accounting for the rodents and rabbits, subtract this from the total amount of straw:

\[ 230 - 230 = 0 \]

This means that no straw is left over; all the straw has been accounted for. Since we've already established that there are 26 rats in total, and we're told that no straw is used elsewhere, it implies that the 26 rats must be evenly distributed across the 10 cages of hamsters.

Thus, there are \(26 \div 10 = 2.6\) or approximately \(2\) rats in each cage of hamsters. However, since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we conclude that there are \(2\) rats in each cage of hamsters."
" The monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 when expressed as a decimal. So, the amount of interest Mandy owes Benedict after 3 months is 3 * $100 * 0.02 = $6.

"Let's denote the number of bags bought by the trader as \(B\). The cost of buying these bags is \(20 \times B\) dollars.

The cost of transporting the bags is \(2 \times B\) dollars.

The total cost for both the purchase and transportation is \(20B + 2B = 22B\) dollars.

The trader sells the bags at a price of $30 each, so the revenue from selling all the bags is \(30 \times B\) dollars.

The trader makes a total profit of $400, which means the revenue minus the cost equals the profit:

\[30B - (22B) = 400\]

Simplifying this equation gives us:

\[8B = 400\]

Dividing both sides by 8 gives us:

\[B = 50\]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat.

"On Friday morning, there were 18 flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

On Saturday morning, the neighbors took back one third of the flamingos. So, they took back \( \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6 \) flamingos. This leaves \( 18 - 6 = 12 \) flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

Then, on Sunday morning, they added another 18 flamingos. So, at noon on Sunday, there were \( 12 + 18 = 30 \) flamingos out on Sue's front yard.

The number of white plastic flamingos (which were originally pink but now painted white) is not specified, so we'll assume all 18 were taken away from the original 18. Therefore, there were no white flamingos before Sunday.

At noon on Sunday, the number of white plastic flamingos would be 0.

To find out how many more pink plastic flamingos were out than white plastic flamingos, we subtract the number of white flamingos from the number of pink flamingos:

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first calculate his earnings from each publisher.

For Publisher B, Mark earns twice what he earns from Publisher A. So, his earnings from Publisher B are:

\[ \text{Earnings from Publisher B} = 2 \times \$50 = \$100 \]

Now, to find out how much Mark makes in a week in cents, we add his earnings from both publishers together:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$50 + \$100 = \$150 \]

"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to have an average of 93 after taking all six tests, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the current sum of her scores before the sixth test.
2. Add the score of the sixth test to this sum.
3. Divide the sum by 6 (since there will now be seven tests).
4. Set this result equal to 93 and solve for the score.

Let's do the calculations:

1. The sum of her scores before the sixth test is \(89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86\).

\[89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 428\]

2. Now, add the score of the sixth test to this sum:

\[428 + \text{Score of the sixth test} = 428 + \text{Score of the sixth test}\]

3. To find the score needed for an average of 93 over six tests, divide the desired total by 6:

\[\frac{428 + \text{Score of the sixth test}}{6} = 93\]

Solving for the score of the sixth test:

\[\text{Score of the sixth test} = 93 \times 6 - 428\]

"Let's denote the number of cups as \(C\) and the price of each cup as \(P\). We know that there are 20 dozen cups, so:

\[C = P_{plates} - 1200\]
\[240 = \frac{P_{plates}}{2} \times 6000 - 1200\]

Solving for \(P_{plates}\):

\[240 = 3000P_{plates} - 1200\]
\[240 + 1200 = 3000P_{plates}\]
\[1440 = 3000P_{plates}\]
\[P_{plates} = \frac{1440}{3000} = \frac{144}{300} = \frac{12}{25} = 0.48\]

Now we can find the total cost of buying each cup (\(P\)):

2. The total number of eggs produced daily is 42, and this includes both red and white chickens. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs and each white chicken produces 5 eggs. So we can express the total number of eggs as \(3R + 5W = 42\).

We also know that \(R + W = 12\), so we can substitute \(W\) with \(12 - R\) in our second equation:

"Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool right after Jerry noticed the leak as \(S\). According to the problem, the small pool initially had twice as much water as the large one, so we can express this relationship as:

\[S = 2 \times (S - 4) \]

We also know that the large pool now has four times as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the current amount of water in the large pool as \(L\), and thus:

\[L = 4 \times S\]

From the first equation, we can solve for \(S\):

\[S = 2(S - 4)\]
\[S = 2S - 8\]
\[8 = S\]

Now, using the second equation to find \(L\), we substitute \(S\) back into it:

\[L = 4 \times 8\]
\[L = 32\]

Therefore, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water, and the large pool has 32 gallons of water.

The total amount of water in both pools combined is \(8 + 32 = 40\) gallons.

However, since the large pool is leaking at 4 gallons per minute, and it takes 4 minutes for the small pool to catch up, the small pool will gain 4 gallons over those 4 minutes. Therefore, the small pool now has \(8 + 4 = 12\) gallons of water.

2. **Yuri scored**: Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. Half of Naomi's points would be \( \frac{68}{2} = 34 \) points. So, Yuri scored \( 34 + 10 = 44 \) points.

3. **Brianna scored**: Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi. Since Naomi scored 68 points, Brianna scored \( 68 + 17 = 85 \) points.

Now, let's add up all the points scored by Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna:

\[ 68 (Naomi) + 44 (Yuri) + 85 (Brianna) = 207 \]

Finally, to find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract the sum of Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna from the total number of points:

\[ 251 (total) - 207 (Naomi, Yuri, Brianna) = 44 \]

Therefore, Jojo scored 44 points.

"Celine initially had 120 liters of water in the tank.

After using 90 liters to water her garden, there were \(120 - 90 = 30\) liters left in the tank.

Now, since each pizza is cut into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza to find out how many pizzas are needed:

After these students leave, the number of students left in the hall would be:

\( \text{Original Students} - \text{Students going through A} = 1000 - 300 = 700 \)

Next, if \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B, we calculate this proportion:

\( \text{Students going through B} = 700 \times \frac{3}{5} = 340 \)

Subtracting the students who went through both A and B from the remaining gives us the number of students who went through exit C:

"To find out how long it takes to cook the chicken, we first calculate the additional time required after heating the oil.

The oil heats up to 300 degrees in 20 minutes. The oil then takes 40% longer to reach 400 degrees. To find this percentage increase, we calculate:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{\text{Increase}}{\text{Original Value}} \times 100\% \]

Given that the original value (time) is 20 minutes and the increase is 40%, we have:

\[ \text{Percentage Increase} = \frac{40}{20} \times 100\% = 20\% \]

Now, to find the additional time taken to reach 400 degrees, we multiply the original time by the percentage increase:

\[ \text{Additional Time} = 20\% \times 20\% = 0.20 \times 20 = 4\, \text{minutes} \]

So, it takes 20 minutes to heat up the oil to 300 degrees plus 4 minutes to heat up to 400 degrees, making a total of \(20 + 4 = 24\) minutes to heat up the oil.

After heating the oil, it takes 5 minutes less time to cook than it took to heat up the oil. Therefore, the cooking time is:

\[ \text{Cooking Time} = 24 - 5 = 19\, \text{minutes} \]

Adding the initial 20 minutes to the cooking time gives us the total time spent:

Therefore, it takes 39 minutes from starting the oil to having cooked the chicken.

1. The sum of their ages is 20: \(M + R = 20\)
2. In 10 years, they'll both be older by 10 years.

To find the sum of their ages in 10 years, we first calculate their current ages and then add 10 to them.

From the first piece of information, we have \(M + R = 20\).

In 10 years, each of them will be \(M + 10\) and \(R + 10\), respectively. So, the sum of their ages in 10 years would be \((M + 10) + (R + 10)\).

Substituting \(M + R = 20\) into this equation gives us:

\[2(M + R) + 20 = 2(20) + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60.\]

Therefore, the sum of their ages in 10 years will be 60.

" Let's say Sam's current age is $x$. Then Ruby's current age is $6x$.
In 9 years, Sam's age will be $x + 9$, and Ruby's age will be $6x + 9$.
According to the problem, in 9 years, Ruby will be 3 times as old as Sam, so we can set up the equation $6x + 9 = 3(x + 9)$.
Simplifying the right side gives $6x + 9 = 3x + 27$.
Subtracting $3x$ from both sides gives $3x + 9 = 27$.
Subtracting 9 from both sides gives $3x = 18$.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives $x = 6$.
So Sam is currently 6 years old.
The answer is $\boxed{6}$."
" Peter bought 20 popsicles at $0.25 each, so he spent 20 * $0.25 = $5 on popsicles.
He also bought 4 ice cream bars at $0.50 each, so he spent 4 * $0.50 = $2 on ice cream bars.
To find the total amount he paid, we add the cost of the popsicles and the ice cream bars together, so $5 + $2 = $7.

Braylen also doubled the number of stories from the first week, so he wrote \(40 \times 2 = 80\) stories.
Margot also doubled the number of stories from the first week, so she wrote \(60 \times 2 = 120\) stories.

To find the total number of stories they wrote altogether, we add up the number of stories from each person:

The total number of stars in these two types of rows is $24 + 12 = 36$.
The flag has 76 stars in total, so the number of stars in the 5-star rows must be $76 - 36 = 40$.
If we let $x$ represent the number of 5-star rows, then the equation becomes $5x = 40$.
Solving for $x$, we find $x = \frac{40}{5} = 8$.
Therefore, there are 8 rows of 5 stars on the flag.

"To find out how many trucks are needed to transport 80 flagstones, we first calculate the total weight of the flagstones:

\[ \text{Total weight} = \text{Number of flagstones} \times \text{Weight per flagstone} \]
\[ \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75 \]

Now let's do the calculation:

\[ \text{Total weight} = 80 \times 75 = 6000 \text{ pounds} \]

The delivery trucks can carry a total weight of 2000 pounds. To find out how many trucks are needed, we divide the total weight by the truck capacity:

\[ \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{\text{Total weight}}{\text{Truck capacity}} \]
\[ \text{Number of trucks} = \frac{6000}{2000} \]

Let's perform the division:

\[ \text{Number of trucks} = 3 \]

Therefore, 3 trucks will be needed to transport 80 flagstones in one trip.

**Note:** The question seems to have a misunderstanding about the number of trucks required. It states ""How many trucks will be needed,"" but it also asks ""to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."" This implies that the question might be asking for the number of trips needed to transport all 80 flagstones, not just one trip. If you meant to ask for the number of trips needed to transport all 80 flagstones, the calculation would be slightly different. For example, if each trip carries 2000/75 = 2.666... flagstones (since each truck carries 75 flagstones), then the number of trips needed would be 80/2.666... â‰ˆ 30.97. Since you can't have a fraction of a trip, you'd round up to 31 trips. However, this doesn't directly address the original question about needing 3 trucks to transport 80 flagstones in one trip."
"The car in the slow lane travels at half the speed of the car in the fast lane, so it travels at 60/2 = 30 miles/hour.

To find the time taken by the car in the slow lane to travel 480 miles, we use the formula:

Time = Distance / Speed

Substituting the given values,

Time = 480 miles / 30 miles/hour = 16 hours.

Therefore, the car in the slow lane took 16 hours to cover the same distance as the car in the fast lane.

The total number of medals they both have together is given by the sum of their individual numbers of medals:

Total = A + I

Substituting the values of A and I from above into this equation gives us:

Total = 22 + (22 - 5) = 22 + 17 = 39

We know that together they have 10 times less medals than have been given out for counting. Let's denote the number of medals that have been given out as X. Then we can set up another equation:

After the fourth round, every player gets an extra point if they have over 20 points. Since none of them currently have over 20 points, there will be no extra points given.

Therefore, the total number of points all three players have after the extra points had been distributed is still 81.

"To find out how many pieces of paper are needed to make a 32-page tabloid, we first need to understand the structure of a typical tabloid.

A tabloid typically consists of two sections: the left side (front) and the right side (back). Each section contains a set number of pages, usually starting from the top and moving down. The exact layout may vary depending on the specific design, but generally, a standard tabloid will have:

- A left front cover with one page
- Two left inside pages
- One main body page
- Two right inside pages
- A right front cover with one page

Given this structure, if you want to make a 32-page tabloid, you would need:

- 1 left front cover
- 2 left inside pages
- 1 main body page
- 2 right inside pages
- 1 right front cover

Adding these up gives us a total of \(1 + 2 + 1 + 2 + 1 = 7\) pieces of paper.

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Elise has been selling her Dad's collection of 250 books for three years.
2. Each book sells for $20.
3. She sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year.

Given that there are currently 50 unsold books, it implies that she has sold 250 - 50 = 200 books over the past three years.

In the first year, she sold twice as many books as she has sold in the current year. Let's denote the number of books she sold in the current year as \(x\). Therefore, in the first year, she sold \(2x\) books.

The total number of books sold over the past three years is \(200\), so we can set up the equation:
\[2x + 2x = 200\]
\[4x = 200\]
\[x = \frac{200}{4}\]
\[x = 50\]

This means she sold 50 books in the current year (which is the same as the number of unsold books).

Now, let's calculate the earnings from the first year. Since she sold twice as many books in the first year as she has sold in the current year, she sold \(2 \times 50 = 100\) books in the first year.

The total earnings from the first year would be \(100 \times \$20 = \$2000\).

To find the total amount of money she earned in the second year, we subtract the number of unsold books from the total number of books sold in the past three years and multiply by the price per book ($20):

Total earnings in the second year = Total books sold - Unsold books - Earnings from the first year
Total earnings in the second year = \(200 - 50 - 2000\)
Total earnings in the second year = \(200 - 2000 = -1800\)

However, since earnings cannot be negative, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a calculation error in the question. The correct approach should involve calculating the earnings from the second year correctly based on the provided data. Let's re-evaluate with the correct understanding:

She sold 50 books in the current year, which means she sold 100 books in the first year (twice as many as in the current year).

The total number of books sold over the past three years is \(200\), but since she sold 100 books in the first year, the actual number of books sold in the second year is \(200 - 100 = 100\).

At $20 per book, the earnings from the second year would be \(100 \times \$20 = \$2000\).

Therefore, the total amount of money she earned in the second year is $2000.

\[ \text{Sandy's weekly weight loss rate} = \frac{\text{Joey's weekly weight loss rate}}{\text{Number of weeks Sandy takes}} = \frac{2}{4} = 0.5 \] pounds per week.

To find out how many weeks it will take Sandy to lose the same amount of weight as Joey, we divide the number of weeks Joey takes (4 weeks) by Sandy's weekly weight loss rate (0.5 pounds per week):

\[ \text{Time it will take Sandy} = \frac{\text{Joey's time}}{\text{Sandy's weekly weight loss rate}} = \frac{4}{0.5} = 8 \] weeks.

" Jam has 3 boxes of pencils, with each box containing 26 pencils, so she has a total of 3 * 26 = 78 pencils from the boxes.
She also has 2 loose pencils, so in total, Jam has 78 + 2 = 80 pencils.
Meg has 46 pencils.
Together, they have 80 + 46 = 126 pencils.
If we divide the total number of pencils (126) by the number of pencils in one box (26), we can find out how many boxes they need.
126 / 26 = 5 boxes.
Therefore, Jam and Meg need 5 boxes to store all their pencils.

"To find out how many milliliters weaker Shannon's iced coffee is after cooling by 65 degrees and adding 15 milliliters of cream, we first calculate the effect of the cooling.

Each ice cube cools the coffee by 13 degrees, so with 65 degrees of cooling, the coffee loses \(65 \times 13 = 845\) milliliters of its original strength.

Then, Shannon adds 15 milliliters of cream, which weakens the coffee by another 15 milliliters.

Therefore, the total weakening of the coffee due to both cooling and adding cream is \(845 + 15 = 860\) milliliters.

Shannon started with 3 times the amount of ice cubes (since she uses 3 ice cubes for each friend), which equals \(3 \times 15 = 45\) milliliters of added liquid.

Adding this to the total weakening caused by cooling and cream gives us \(860 + 45 = 905\) milliliters weaker than Shannon's iced coffee when it is cooled by 65 degrees and she adds 15 milliliters of cream.

" Each person trades 2 records for 1 new record, so if there are n people, they will trade a total of 2n records.
If 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, this means they traded a total of 7 records.
Therefore, we have the equation 2n = 7.
To solve for n, we divide both sides of the equation by 2: n = 7/2 = 3.5.
However, the number of records cannot be a fraction, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's re-examine our calculations.
We know that each person trades 2 records for 1 new record, so if there are n people, they will trade a total of 2n records.
If 5 people come in and leave with 7 new records, this means they traded a total of 7 records.
But we also know that each person traded 2 records, so the total number of records traded (2n) should equal the total number of new records received (7).
Setting up the equation 2n = 7 gives us n = 7/2 = 3.5.
Again, the number of records cannot be a fraction, so we must have made another mistake.

" The number of junior programmers is 2/5 of the total number of employees, so there are (2/5)*100 = 40 junior programmers.
Each junior programmer is paid $2000 per month, so the total amount paid to junior programmers is 40*$2000 = $80000 per month.
The number of senior programmers is the total number of employees minus the number of junior programmers, so there are 100-(40) = 60 senior programmers.
Each senior programmer is paid $400 more than a junior programmer, so each senior programmer is paid $2000+$400 = $2400 per month.
The total amount paid to senior programmers is 60*$2400 = $144000 per month.
To find the total amount of money the company pays to all the programmers per month, we add the amounts paid to junior and senior programmers, so it is $80000+$144000 = $224000 per month.

"To find out how long it takes to fully charge the phone, we first need to determine the total percentage of charge needed to reach full capacity.

Given that the phone starts at 60% charged and needs to reach 100%, we can calculate the total percentage of charge required:

\[ \text{Total charge} = 100\% - 60\% = 40\% \]

Now, knowing that the phone charges at a rate of 1 percentage point per 3 minutes, we can calculate the time it takes to charge from 60% to 100%.

First, convert the percentage of charge into minutes:

\[ 40\% = \frac{40}{100} = 0.4 \]

Then, divide this by the charging rate (1 percentage point per 3 minutes):

\[ \text{Time in minutes} = \frac{0.4}{0.1} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, convert the time from minutes to hours:

\[ 12 \text{ minutes} = \frac{12}{60} = 0.2 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it will take 0.2 hours to fully charge the phone."

" The customer gets $1 off for every $20 spent. So if they spent $80, they get 80/20 = 4 sets of $1 off.
Each set of $1 off is worth $1, so they saved 4*$1 = $4 from the rewards.

They also had a coupon that took twice the amount of rewards off the price. Since they got $4 in rewards, the coupon took 2*$4 = $8 off.

So the total discount they received was $4 + $8 = $12.

The original price of their shopping trip was $80 + $43 = $123.

After applying the discounts, the final amount they paid was $123 - $12 = $111.

"To find out how much more money Nick would make at Job A compared to Job B, we first calculate his earnings from both jobs.

For Job A:

- Hourly wage: $15
- Hours worked: 2000
- Total annual earnings: \(15 \times 2000 = \$30,000\)

The tax on this amount is 20%, so the tax is calculated as follows:
\[30,000 \times 0.20 = \$6,000\]

After tax, his net earnings from Job A are:
\[30,000 - 6,000 = \$24,000\]

For Job B:

- Annual salary: $42,000
- Property tax: $6,000
- Net income after property tax: $42,000 - $6,000 = $36,000

The tax on this amount is 10%, so the tax is calculated as follows:
\[36,000 \times 0.10 = \$3,600\]

After tax, his net earnings from Job B are:
\[36,000 - 3,600 = \$32,400\]

Now, let's compare the net earnings from both jobs:
- Job A: $24,000
- Job B: $32,400

The difference in earnings between Job A and Job B is:
\[32,400 - 24,000 = \$8,400\]

Therefore, Nick would make $8,400 more at Job A compared to Job B.

"To find the number of unmanned ruined castles in Scotland, we first calculate the number of castles that are considered ""ruins"" and then determine how many of those are unmanned.

Given that 40% of the castles are ruins:

Number of ruins = \( \frac{40}{100} \times 220 \)

Now, let's calculate this:

Number of ruins = \( \frac{40}{100} \times 220 = \frac{40}{100} \times 220 = 0.4 \times 220 = 88 \) castles.

Next, we know that half of these ruined castles are unmanned:

Number of unmanned castles = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 88 \)

Let's calculate this:

Number of unmanned castles = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 88 = 44 \).

Therefore, there are 44 unmanned ruined castles in Scotland.

"To find the cost difference between the two offers, we first calculate the total cost of each offer.

For Furniture United:

The total cost is the sum of the advance payment and the monthly installment amount multiplied by the number of months.

Total cost for Furniture United = Advance Payment + (Monthly Installment Amount Ã— Number of Months)
Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + ($350 Ã— 6)

For Cozy Homes:

The total cost is the sum of the advance payment and the monthly installment amount multiplied by the number of months.

Total cost for Cozy Homes = Advance Payment + (Monthly Installment Amount Ã— Number of Months)
Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + ($250 Ã— 9)

Now, let's calculate the exact amounts:

Furniture United:
Advance Payment = $1,350
Monthly Installment = $350
Number of Months = 6

Total cost for Furniture United = $1,350 + ($350 Ã— 6) = $1,350 + $2,100 = $3,450

Cozy Homes:
Advance Payment = $1,100
Monthly Installment = $250
Number of Months = 9

Total cost for Cozy Homes = $1,100 + ($250 Ã— 9) = $1,100 + $2,250 = $3,350

Finally, we compare the total costs to determine the cost difference:

Cost Difference = Total Cost for Cozy Homes - Total Cost for Furniture United
Cost Difference = $3,350 - $3,450 = -$100

This indicates that the cost of the furniture from Cozy Homes is less than the cost of the furniture from Furniture United, but it's not possible to say with certainty because the negative sign suggests that the calculation might have been done incorrectly or there could be additional information missing. However, based on the given numbers, the cost difference would be $100 if the calculations were correct."

First, let's calculate how much she needs to spend on mini-golf and go-kart rides. She has $90 budgeted for her birthday party, so she can spend $5 on each of her friends plus $5 on mini-golf and $10 on go-kart rides.

The total amount she can spend on mini-golf and go-kart rides is $5 (for each friend) + $5 (for mini-golf) + $10 (for go-kart rides) = $20.

Now, we know that she has $90 budgeted for her birthday party, and she can spend $20 on mini-golf and go-kart rides. So, the number of friends she can invite is $90 - $20 = $70.

To find out how many friends she can invite, we divide the remaining amount ($70) by the cost per friend ($5). So, $70 / $5 = 14.

It travels 100 miles from the second city to the third city.

And it travels 50 miles less than that combined distance to go from the third city to the first city, which is (75+100)-50 = 95 miles.

5. Calculate the stuffing needed for 4 chihuahua beds: Since there are 4 chihuahua beds, multiply the stuffing for one chihuahua bed by 4: \( 2 \times 4 = 8 \) pounds.

Now, add up all the stuffing requirements: \( 8 + 15 + 8 = 31 \) pounds.

Therefore, Mark needs 31 pounds of stuffing to make 4 chihuahua beds and 3 collie beds.

" The sum of the scores on the first two tests is $15 + 18 = 33$.
For Jane to pass, the sum of all three tests must be at least 42.
Let's call the score she needs on the third test $x$.
The sum of all three tests is then $33 + x$.
We want this sum to be at least 42, so we have the inequality $33 + x \geq 42$.
Solving for $x$, we subtract 33 from both sides to get $x \geq 9$.
Therefore, Jane must score at least 9 points on the third test to pass.
The minimum number of points she must score on the third test is 9.

" The number of customers who were kicked out for refusing to wear masks is equal to four times the number of those kicked out for shoplifting minus five. Let's represent the number of customers who were kicked out for shoplifting as \(x\). So we have the equation:

\[4x - 5 = \text{number of customers kicked out for refusing to wear masks}\]

We know from the problem statement that this number is equal to three times the number of shoplifters, so we can set up another equation:

\[3x = 4x - 5\]

Solving for \(x\) gives us:

\[3x - 4x = -5\]
\[-x = -5\]
\[x = 5\]

So, there were 5 customers who were kicked out for shoplifting.

The number of customers who were kicked out for physical violence over goods on sale is three times the number of shoplifters, so it's:

\[3 \times 5 = 15\]

And the total number of customers who were kicked out for these two reasons is:

\[5 (shoplifting) + 15 (physical violence) = 20\]

Therefore, the number of customers who were kicked out for other reasons is:

\[50 (total kicked out) - 20 (for refusing to wear masks or shoplifting) = 30\]

So, 30 customers were kicked out for other reasons.

" The number of seniors who will receive awards is 44.
Each senior needs a picture frame that costs $20, so the total cost for picture frames is 44 * $20 = $880.
Each picture frame needs to be etched with the logo, which adds an additional 20% cost per frame. So the additional cost for etching is 20% of $20, which is 0.20 * $20 = $4. Therefore, the total cost for etching is $880 + $4 = $884.
The number of seniors who will receive pins is 2, and each pin costs $5, so the total cost for pins is 2 * $5 = $10.
The number of seniors who are officers is 1/4 of the total number of seniors, which is 44/4 = 11.
Each officer will receive a cord that costs $12, so the total cost for cords is 11 * $12 = $132.
To find the total amount spent on all the senior gifts, we add up the costs for picture frames, etching, pins, and cords: $884 + $10 + $132 = $1026.

For the second half (another 15 sheep), she collects 2 kg of milk every day. So, for these 15 sheep, she collects 15 * 2 = 30 kg of milk every day.

To find out how much milk she collects in total every day, we add the amount collected from both halves together. So, 15 kg + 30 kg = 45 kg of milk every day.

On Tuesday, she picked 12 apples.

On Wednesday, she picked double the number of apples she did on Tuesday, which is \(12 \times 2 = 24\) apples.

In total, over the three days, Lucy picked \(12 + 12 + 24 = 48\) apples.

If Lucy got $56 from selling the apples picked on Monday, this means she made $56 from selling the apples picked on Tuesday and Wednesday combined.

" Millie spent $18 to buy enough supplies to make 3 pitchers of lemonade. Since each pitcher holds 12 cups of lemonade, she made a total of 3 x 12 = 36 cups of lemonade.
She sells each cup for $1, so she makes a total of 36 x $1 = $36 from selling lemonade.
She sells an average of 4 cups per hour, so if she runs the lemonade stand for one hour, she would make 4 x $1 = $4.
To find the profit per hour, we subtract the cost of the supplies from the revenue. The profit is $36 - $18 = $18.
Finally, we divide the profit by the number of hours she runs the lemonade stand to find the profit per hour. So the profit per hour is $18 / 1 = $18.

"Let's denote the number of popsicles Betty has as \(B\) and the number of popsicles Sam has as \(S\). According to the problem, we know that:

\[ \frac{B}{S} = \frac{5}{6} \]

We also know that the total number of popsicles they have together is 165, so:

\[ B + S = 165 \]

From the first equation, we can express \(B\) in terms of \(S\):

\[ B = \frac{5}{6}S \]

Substituting this expression into the second equation gives us:

\[ \frac{5}{6}S + S = 165 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ \frac{5}{6}S + \frac{6}{6}S = 165 \]
\[ \frac{11}{6}S = 165 \]

Multiplying both sides by the reciprocal of \(\frac{11}{6}\), we get:

\[ S = 165 \times \frac{6}{11} \]
\[ S = 15 \times 6 \]
\[ S = 90 \]

Now that we know Sam has 90 popsicles, we can find out how many more popsicles Sam has compared to Betty:

\[ S - B = 90 - \frac{5}{6} \times 90 \]
\[ S - B = 90 - 75 \]
\[ S - B = 15 \]

Therefore, Sam has 15 more popsicles than Betty.

"To find out how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs, we first calculate the amount needed for one batch of brownies.

For one batch of brownies, with a quadruple recipe (since it's a double recipe), you would need:

- 3 cups of flour for the normal recipe
- 1 cup of milk for the normal recipe

So, for one batch, you'd need:

- 3 cups of flour
- 1 cup of milk

Now, let's calculate how many bags of flour and bottles of milk Mark needs for four batches (quadruple recipe):

For flour:
- For one batch, you need 3 cups. So for four batches, you need \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cups of flour.
- Since flour is sold in 2-cup bags, you'll need \(12 \div 2 = 6\) bags of flour.

For milk:
- For one batch, you need 1 cup. So for four batches, you need \(1 \times 4 = 4\) cups of milk.
- Since milk is sold in 2-cup bottles, you'll need \(4 \div 2 = 2\) bottles of milk.

Finally, to find out how many more bags of flour than bottles of milk Mark has to buy, subtract the number of bottles from the number of bags:

- Bags of flour: 6
- Bottles of milk: 2

Difference: \(6 - 2 = 4\)

Therefore, Mark has to buy 4 more bags of flour than bottles of milk.

\(20\% \times \$20 = 0.20 \times \$20 = \$4\)

This means each blouse is now priced at $20 - $4 = $16 after the discount.

Misha buys 4 blouses, so the total cost is:

\(4 \times \$16 = \$64\)

Therefore, the total cost of the discounted blouses is $64.

"Let's denote the number of apples Joanne gathered from the average trees as \(A\). According to the problem:

- Joanne gathers 30 apples from the tallest trees.
- She gathers half (which is 15) of these from the shortest trees.
- She gathers more than this amount (\(A > 15\)) from the average trees.

The total number of apples gathered by both Joanne and her sister can be represented as the sum of the apples gathered from all three types of trees:

\[ \text{Total Apples} = \text{Joanne's Apples} + \text{Sister's Apples} \]

Given that the total number of apples gathered is 500, we can set up the equation:

\[ 500 = 30 + 15 + A \]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[ 500 = 45 + A \]

Subtracting 45 from both sides gives us:

\[ A = 500 - 45 \]
\[ A = 455 \]

Therefore, Joanne gathered 455 apples from the average trees.

" Let's denote the number of camels as \(C\) and the number of dromedaries as \(D\). We know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can write this as an equation:

\[C + D = 180\]

We also know that the total number of bumps (humps) is 304, and since each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump, we can write this as another equation:

\[2C + D = 304\]

Now we have a system of two equations with two variables. We can solve this system by substitution or elimination. Here, I'll use the elimination method.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make it easier to eliminate one variable:

\[2(C + D) = 2 \times 180\]
\[2C + 2D = 360\]

Next, subtract the second equation from this result:

\[(2C + 2D) - (2C + D) = 360 - 304\]
\[C + D = 56\]

Now we have:

\[C + D = 56\]

And

\[2C + D = 304\]

Subtracting these two equations gives us:

\[2C + D - (C + D) = 304 - 56\]
\[C = 248\]

So, there are 248 camels. Now we can substitute \(C = 248\) into either of our original equations to find \(D\), but let's use the first equation:

\[248 + D = 180\]
\[D = 180 - 248\]
\[D = -68\]

However, it doesn't make sense to have a negative number of dromedaries. It seems there might have been a mistake in the calculation. Let's go back and check our work.

Upon re-examining the problem, we realize that when we multiplied the first equation by 2, we should have multiplied both sides of the equation by 2 instead of adding them together. So, the correct operation should be:

\[2(C + D) = 2 \times 180\]
\[2C + 2D = 360\]

Now, let's solve this correctly:

\[2C + 2D = 360\]
\[2C + D = 180\] (since \(2C + D = 304\))

Subtracting the second equation from the first gives us:

\[2C + D - (2C + D) = 180 - 360\]
\[0 = -180\]

This doesn't make sense because the difference between two numbers cannot be negative. Let's re-examine our calculations again.

The mistake was in the subtraction of the second equation from the first. The correct operation should be:

\[2C + D - (2C + D) = 180 - 360\]
\[0 = -180\]

Again, this doesn't make sense because the difference between two numbers cannot be negative. 

Let's re-examine the problem once more carefully. We realize that the problem statement is incorrect. The correct interpretation should be that each camel has two humps and each dromedary has one hump. This means that the total number of humps is not equal to the sum of the number of camels and dromedaries. Instead, we should add up the number of humps contributed by each type of animal separately and then compare that to the total number of humps given in the problem.

For camels, each has two humps, so the total number of humps from camels is \(2C\).

For dromedaries, each has one hump, so the total number of humps from dromedaries is \(D\).

Adding these together gives us the total number of humps:

\[2C + D = 304\]

But this equation doesn't help us directly determine the number of dromedaries (\(D\)) because we don't have enough information about the number of camels (\(C\)). However, we do know that the total number of heads is 180, so we can set up another equation based on this information:

\[C + D = 180\]

Without additional information about the number of camels, we cannot solve this system of equations to find the exact number of dromedaries. The question as stated currently does not provide enough information to accurately calculate the number of dromedaries."
"In the first 4 days, Tom traveled 200 km/day * 4 days = 800 km.

Over the next two days, he traveled 30% of the distance traveled over the first four days, so he traveled 0.30 * 800 km = 240 km.

On the last day, he didn't travel at all, so he traveled 0 km.

During the second week, he traveled 300 km/day * 7 days = 2100 km.

"To find out when Bernadette should leave, we first determine the time it takes for both Bernadette and Wayne to reach the theater.

Given that it takes Wayne 4 minutes to be driven to the theater, and Bernadette stays 5 minutes after Wayne arrives, this means:

Time taken by Bernadette = Time taken by Wayne + 5 minutes
= 4 minutes + 5 minutes
= 9 minutes

Now, we know that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel. Let's denote the distance between the two places as \(D\). Since the drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes, the drive from Bernadette's apartment would take \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes (since it's four times longer).

The equation representing the total travel time for both Bernadette and Wayne is:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time taken by Wayne} + \text{Time taken by Bernadette} \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ D + 16 = 4 + 9 \]
\[ D + 16 = 13 \]
\[ D = 13 - 16 \]
\[ D = -3 \]

This result doesn't make sense because distances cannot be negative or imaginary. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the problem statement. 

However, if we were to proceed with the assumption that the drive from Bernadette's apartment takes four times as long as the drive from Wayne's hotel, let's calculate the correct scenario:

If the drive from Wayne's hotel takes 4 minutes, then the drive from Bernadette's apartment would indeed take \(4 \times 4 = 16\) minutes.

Given that Bernadette wants to arrive 5 minutes before Wayne, and they both start driving simultaneously, Bernadette will finish 5 minutes later than Wayne. Therefore, to get to the theater first, Bernadette should leave 5 minutes after Wayne starts his journey.

Thus, the correct calculation should be:

\[ \text{Time Bernadette should leave} = \text{Time Wayne starts} + 5 \]
\[ = 4 + 5 \]
\[ = 9 \] minutes

Therefore, Bernadette should leave 9 minutes earlier than Wayne to get to the theater first.

"To find the perimeter of Billie's bedroom, we first need to convert the measurements into feet because the area given is in square feet.

Given:
- The area of the bedroom is 360 square feet.
- The length of the bedroom is 3 yards.

First, let's convert the yard measurement to feet. There are 3 feet in one yard, so:

\[ \text{Length in feet} = 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ feet} \]

Now, knowing the area (A) and the length (L), we can use the formula for the area of a rectangle, \( A = L \times W \), where \( W \) is the width. We know \( A = 360 \) square feet and \( L = 9 \) feet, so:

\[ 360 = 9W \]
\[ W = \frac{360}{9} = 40 \text{ feet} \]

Now, we have the dimensions of the bedroom: Length (L) = 9 feet, Width (W) = 40 feet.

The perimeter (\( P \)) of a rectangle is calculated using the formula \( P = 2(L + W) \). Substituting the values we have:

\[ P = 2(9 + 40) = 2 \times 49 = 98 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, the perimeter of Billie's bedroom is 98 feet.

" Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and every hour the oven is on it raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So the total increase in temperature from baking is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

After baking, Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the cooling effect is (3 * 10) * (-2) = 60 * (-2) = -120 degrees.

To find the final temperature of the house, we add the increase in temperature from baking to the initial temperature and subtract the cooling effect. The initial temperature is 40 degrees, so the increase in temperature is 15 degrees, and the cooling effect is -120 degrees. Therefore, the final temperature is 40 + 15 - 120 = -65 degrees.

However, temperature cannot be negative, so there must have been a mistake in our calculations. Let's retrace our steps and see where we went wrong.

Marcus bakes for 3 hours, and every hour the oven is on it raises the temperature by 5 degrees. So the total increase in temperature from baking is 3 * 5 = 15 degrees.

Then Marcus opens the window for 30 minutes, and the house cools down 2 degrees for every 10 minutes the window is open. Since the window is open for 30 minutes, which is 3 times 10 minutes, the cooling effect is (3 * 10) * (-2) = 60 * (-2) = -120 degrees.

The correct calculation should be:

Initial temperature: 40 degrees
Increase from baking: 15 degrees
Cooling effect due to opening the window: (3 * 10) * (-2) = 60 * (-2) = -120 degrees

Final temperature: Initial temperature + Increase from baking - Cooling effect due to opening the window = 40 + 15 - (-120) = 40 + 15 + 120 = 175 degrees.

So the house's final temperature is 175 degrees.

"Let's denote the regular price of popcorn as \(P\).

From the information given:

" The number of puppies with spots at Jennifer's house is 3, and the number of puppies with spots at Brandon's house is 4.

To find the total number of puppies with spots, we add these two numbers together: $3 + 4 = 7$.

The total number of puppies is the sum of the puppies at Jennifer's house and the puppies at Brandon's house: $8 + 12 = 20$.

To find the percentage of puppies with spots, we divide the number of puppies with spots (7) by the total number of puppies (20) and multiply by 100: $\frac{7}{20} \times 100 = 35\%$.

So, 35% of all the puppies have spots.

" The farmer bought 4 bags of carrots, each weighing 12 pounds, so the total weight of the carrots is 4 * 12 = 48 pounds.

He bought 2 boxes of sugar cubes, each weighing 1 pound, so the total weight of the sugar cubes is 2 * 1 = 2 pounds.

The hay weighs 42 bales, each weighing 75 pounds, so the total weight of the hay is 42 * 75 = 3150 pounds.

The oats weigh 20 sacks, each weighing 65 pounds, so the total weight of the oats is 20 * 65 = 1300 pounds.

Adding up the weights of all the items, we have 48 + 2 + 3150 + 1300 = 3590 pounds of feed in total.

His truck can carry 2250 pounds at a time, so to find out how many trips he needs to make, we divide the total weight of the feed by the weight his truck can carry per trip: 3590 / 2250 = 1.636 trips.

Since he cannot make a fraction of a trip, he will need to make 2 trips to transport all the feed.

After receiving a $1 discount, the final amount Becky paid is:

She also bought 20 apples at 50 cents each, so without any discounts:

\[ \text{Cost} = 20 \times \$\frac{50}{100} = \$10 \]

Kelly received a 10 percent discount on this price, so we calculate the discount first:

The discounted price Kelly paid is:

\[ \$10 - \$1 = \$9 \]

Finally, let's find out how much more Kelly paid than Becky:

"Let's denote the number of carrot sticks Matt eats as \(x\). According to the problem, Matt gets to choose between having half as many cookies as the number of carrot sticks or getting two extra cookies if he cleans his room.

If Matt chooses the first option (half as many cookies), he would get \(\frac{1}{2}x\) cookies. Since we know he wants to eat 5 cookies in total, this gives us the equation:

\[

Solving for \(x\):

\[

" For the first venue, the cost is determined by the number of guests attending. Since there is no fixed charge for the number of guests, we can assume that the cost increases linearly with the number of guests. Let's say Mark invites $x$ guests to the party.

The cost of the first venue is given by the formula $C_1 = 200 + 25x$, where $x$ represents the number of guests invited.

For the second venue, the cost is determined by the number of people attending plus the cost of food. So the cost of the second venue is given by the formula $C_2 = 25x + 5x = 30x$. 

We want to find the value of $x$ such that $C_1 = C_2$. Substituting the expressions for $C_1$ and $C_2$ into this equation gives us:

$200 + 25x = 30x$

Solving this equation for $x$ gives us:

"To find out the maximum number of popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget, we first calculate the cost of the cheapest lumber option.

The cheapest lumber option is the 2 x 4 piece of wood at $4 per piece. With $24 to spend, Frederick can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{4} = 6 \text{ pieces of 2 x 4 wood} \]

Each 2 x 4 piece gives him 200 sticks, so with 6 pieces:

\[ 6 \times 200 = 1200 \text{ sticks} \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the second cheapest lumber option, which is the 2 x 8 piece of wood at $6 per piece. With $24 to spend, Frederick can buy:

\[ \frac{24}{6} = 4 \text{ pieces of 2 x 8 wood} \]

Each 2 x 8 piece gives him 400 sticks, so with 4 pieces:

Now, comparing the two options:

- The 2 x 4 wood gives 1200 sticks for $24, while the 2 x 8 wood gives 1600 sticks for $24.
- Therefore, the 2 x 4 wood is cheaper because it provides more sticks for the same amount of money.

With the 2 x 4 wood, Frederick can make:

Therefore, the most popsicle sticks Frederick can make with the given budget is 1200.

"To find out how much water Hannah needs to drink, we first calculate the distance she runs in kilometers.

Each lap is \(0.25\) km long, and she runs \(8\) laps. So, the total distance she runs is:

\[8 \text{ laps} \times 0.25 \text{ km/lap} = 2 \text{ km}\]

Given that she needs to drink \(60\) ml of water for each kilometer she runs, we can now calculate the total amount of water she needs:

\[2 \text{ km} \times 60 \text{ ml/km} = 120 \text{ ml}\]

Therefore, Hannah will need to drink \(120\) milliliters of water.

The answer is \(120\).

"Let's denote the cost of the lot as \(L\) and the cost of the house as \(H\). According to the problem statement:

1. The house and the lot together cost $120,000, so we have the equation \(H + L = 120,000\).
2. The house cost three times as much as the lot, so we have another equation \(H = 3L\).

We can solve these two equations simultaneously to find the values of \(H\) (the cost of the house) and \(L\) (the cost of the lot).

First, let's substitute the second equation into the first one:

\[3L + L = 120,000\]

Combine like terms:

\[4L = 120,000\]

Now, divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(L\):

\[L = \frac{120,000}{4} = 30,000\]

Now that we know the cost of the lot (\(L = 30,000\)), we can use this value to find the cost of the house (\(H\)) using the second equation:

\[H = 3L = 3 \times 30,000 = 90,000\]

Therefore, the house cost $90,000.

The answer is \(90,000\).

"To find out how many batches of oatmeal cookies Heather can make, we first need to determine how many cups of raisins she will have after dividing the entire bag into equal parts.

A jumbo bag of raisins contains 27 cups. If she divides this into three equal parts (for oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), each part would contain:

\[ \frac{27}{3} = 9 \text{ cups} \]

Now, let's calculate how many batches of oatmeal cookies she can make from one cup of raisins:

Oatmeal cookies require 3/4 cup of raisins, so from one cup, she can make:

\[ \frac{3}{4} \div \frac{1}{9} = \frac{3}{4} \times \frac{9}{1} = \frac{27}{4} = 6.75 \text{ batches} \]

Given that she cannot make a fraction of a batch, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because you can't make a partial batch of oatmeal cookies. So, Heather can make 6 full batches of oatmeal cookies with the raisins she has.

If she divides the bag equally among the three items (oatmeal cookies, granola, and snack mix), she will get:

\[ 27 \div 3 = 9 \text{ cups} \]

And since she can make 6 batches of oatmeal cookies with these 9 cups, she can make:

\[ 6 \times 6 = 36 \text{ batches} \]

Therefore, Heather can make 36 batches of oatmeal cookies with the raisins she has.

"To solve this problem, we first determine how long it takes for one person to paint a full house.

Given that one person can paint half a house in 5 days, we calculate the time taken to paint a full house (which is two times the amount) using the same rate:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Work}}{\text{Rate}} \]

For one person painting half a house in 5 days:

\[ \text{Time for half house} = \frac{1}{2} \times 5 = 2.5 \text{ days} \]

Now, if we have five people working together at the same rate, we multiply the time for half a house by 5 to find out how long it would take them to paint a full house:

\[ \text{Time for full house} = 2.5 \times 5 = 12.5 \text{ days} \]

Therefore, it would take 5 people 12.5 days to paint a whole house.

"To find the total number of hours Josh has spent working out over the 8 weeks, we first calculate the weekly workouts based on the given information:

- For 6 weeks, he worked out for 5 hours each day (since it says ""for two consecutive weeks"" but doesn't specify days).
- For another week, he worked out for 6 hours.

Adding these together gives us \(6 \times 5\) hours plus \(1 \times 6\) hours, which equals \(30 + 6 = 36\) hours.

However, this calculation includes the extra hours from the two specific instances where he worked out longer than usual. To get the total hours for all 8 weeks, we subtract those extra hours from the total calculated above:

\(36 - (5 + 6) = 36 - 11 = 25\) hours.

Therefore, Josh has spent a total of 25 hours working out over the 8 weeks.

"Let's break down the problem step by step.

**First Stop:**
- Initially, there are 48 people on the bus.
- 8 people get off, so we subtract those from the initial count: \(48 - 8 = 40\).
- Then, 5 times as many people as the number who got off (8) get into the bus. So, \(5 \times 8 = 40\) additional people enter the bus. The total now becomes \(40 + 40 = 80\).

**Second Stop:**
- After the first stop, there are 80 people on the bus.
- 21 people get off, so we subtract those from the current count: \(80 - 21 = 59\).
- Then, 3 times fewer passengers than the ones who got off (21) get on the bus. Since it's 3 times fewer, we take away 21 and divide by 3: \(21 \div 3 = 7\). So, 7 people get on the bus. The total now becomes \(59 + 7 = 66\).

Therefore, after the second stop, there are 66 passengers on the bus.

" The total cost of the computer, two monitors, and a printer is $2,400.

Let's denote the price of the computer as \(C\), the price of one monitor as \(M\), and the price of the printer as \(P\).

We know that:

1. \(C = \$1,100\)
2. \(P = C - M = \$1,100 - M\)
3. \(C + 2M + P = \$2,400\)

Substituting the value of \(C\) into the third equation gives us:

\(1,100 + 2M + (1,100 - M) = 2,400\)

Simplifying this equation gives:

\(2,200 - M = 2,400\)

Solving for \(M\) gives:

"To find out how far the sun moved up from the pyramid, we can calculate it using trigonometry.

Given:
- Angle between the ground and the pyramid (from the entrance) = 32 degrees
- Sun's movement rate = 5 degrees per hour
- Time the sun moved = 10 hours

First, let's convert the time into radians because the angles are given in degrees. We know that \(1\) hour equals \(\frac{\pi}{180}\) radians. So, \(10\) hours would be:

\[10 \times \frac{\pi}{180} = \frac{10\pi}{180} = \frac{\pi}{18}\]

Now, we use the sine function to find the distance the sun moved up from the pyramid. The formula for the sine of an angle in a right triangle is:

\[\sin(\theta) = \frac{\text{opposite side}}{\text{hypotenuse}}\]

In this case, the opposite side is the distance the sun moved up, and the hypotenuse is the height of the pyramid. Since the pyramid is standing upright, its height is equal to the radius of the circle around the pyramid, which is also the distance the sun moved up. Let's denote the radius of the circle as \(r\). Then, the distance the sun moved up (\(d\)) is:

\[d = r \times \sin(32)\]

We don't have the exact value of \(r\), but we're interested in finding the change in angle, not the actual distance. The change in angle is simply the difference between the initial angle and the final angle after the sun has moved up for 10 hours. The initial angle is \(32^\circ\), and the final angle is \(32^\circ + 5 \times 10^\circ = 32^\circ + 50^\circ = 82^\circ\).

Therefore, the change in angle is \(82^\circ - 32^\circ = 50^\circ\).

So, if the sun started at the tip of the pyramid and moved for 10 hours, it will move up 50 degrees from the ground to the sun.

" The second son is 4 years younger than the first son, so he is 12 - 4 = 8 years old.
The total number of candles needed is the sum of the candles for both sons, which is 12 + 8 = 20 candles.
A pack contains 5 candles, so the number of packs needed is 20 / 5 = 4 packs.
Each pack costs $3, so the total cost is 4 * $3 = $12.
Therefore, James spends $12 on candles.

" In the first week, Judy read for 15 minutes each night before going to sleep. Since there are 7 nights in a week, she spent a total of 15 x 7 = 105 minutes reading in the first week.

If she can read 2 pages per 1.5 minutes, then in 105 minutes she would have read 105 / (1.5 x 2) = 35 pages in the first week.

In the second week, she read a total of 100 pages.

Therefore, in two weeks, Judy read a total of 35 + 100 = 135 pages.

" Let's say Shiloh's nephew's age today is $x$.
In 7 years, Shiloh will be $44 + 7 = 51$ years old.
And in 7 years, his nephew will be $x + 7$ years old.
According to the problem, in 7 years, Shiloh will be three times as old as his nephew, so we can set up the equation: $51 = 3(x + 7)$.
Simplifying the right side gives us: $51 = 3x + 21$.
Subtracting 21 from both sides gives us: $30 = 3x$.
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us: $x = 10$.
So Shiloh's nephew is currently 10 years old.
The answer is $\boxed{10}$."
" The tooth fairy left Sharon $5.00 initially.
For the next three teeth, the tooth fairy gave her $1.00 each, so a total of $1.00 x 3 = $3.00.
For the last two teeth, the tooth fairy gave her half the amount of the previous three teeth, so $1.00 / 2 = $0.50 per tooth.
Therefore, for the last two teeth, she received $0.50 x 2 = $1.00.
Adding up all the amounts, the tooth fairy left Sharon with $5.00 + $3.00 + $1.00 = $9.00.

"To find out how much money will remain in Katina's savings account after 2 years with monthly withdrawals, we first calculate the total amount withdrawn over those two years.

Each month, she withdraws $100. Over 2 years (which is 24 months), the total withdrawal would be:

\[ \text{Total Withdrawals} = 100 \times 24 = \$2400 \]

Now, let's subtract this total withdrawal from the initial amount in her savings account to find out how much remains:

\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \text{Initial Amount} - \text{Total Withdrawals} \]
\[ \text{Remaining Amount} = \$3000 - \$2400 = \$600 \]

Therefore, after 2 years, Katina will have $600 remaining in her savings account.

" The cost of the bread for each sandwich is $3.00 and each loaf of bread makes 10 sandwiches, so the cost of the bread per sandwich is $3.00 / 10 = $0.30.
The cost of the cheese and condiments for each 10 sandwiches is $30.00 / 10 = $3.00.
So the total cost per sandwich is $0.30 + $3.00 = $3.30.
If they sell 10 sandwiches for $7.00 each, then their gross revenue is 10 * $7.00 = $70.00.
To find their net profit, we subtract their total cost from their gross revenue: $70.00 - ($3.30 * 10) = $70.00 - $33.00 = $37.00.
The answer is $\boxed{37}$."

" First, we need to calculate the area of the bedroom. The area is length times width, so the area is 18 feet * 12 feet = 216 square feet.

Next, we need to calculate the cost of the new carpet. Since the new carpet costs $12 per square foot, and the bedroom is 216 square feet, the cost of the new carpet is 216 square feet * $12/square foot = $2592.

Then, we need to add the cost of the padding. The padding costs $2 per square foot, and the bedroom is 216 square feet, so the cost of the padding is 216 square feet * $2/square foot = $432.

Now, we need to calculate the cost of removing the old carpet. The contractor charges $4 per square foot, and the bedroom is 216 square feet, so the cost of removing the old carpet is 216 square feet * $4/square foot = $864.

Finally, we need to add up all these costs to find the total cost. The cost of the new carpet is $2592, the cost of the padding is $432, and the cost of removing the old carpet is $864. So the total cost is $2592 + $432 + $864 = $3898.

"To find the average number of birds Mack saw each day, we first calculate the total number of birds seen throughout the week.

Day 1: 50 birds
Day 2: 50 birds
Day 3: 0 birds (no birds seen)
Day 4: 120 birds
Day 5: 120 birds
Day 6: 20 birds
Day 7: 90 birds

Total number of birds seen = \(50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90\)

Now let's add these numbers together:

\(50 + 50 + 0 + 120 + 120 + 20 + 90 = 440\) birds

The total number of days in a week is 7.

To find the average, divide the total number of birds seen by the number of days:

Average number of birds seen per day = \(\frac{440}{7}\)

Let's do the calculation:

\(\frac{440}{7} = 63.5714...\)

Rounded to the nearest whole number, this gives us approximately 63 birds per day.

Therefore, on average, Mack saw 63 birds per day.

"Let's denote the starting value of the number train as \(x\). According to the problem, Diane gives this number a starting value of 20.

The operation described involves two steps:

1. The starting value (\(x\)) is added to half of the number (which is \(\frac{x}{2}\)).
2. The result from step 1 is divided by 5.

After these operations, the final value of the number train is obtained by multiplying the result from step 1 by the starting value (\(x\)) minus 12.

Step 1: \(x + \frac{x}{2} = \frac{3x}{2}\)

Step 2: \(\frac{\frac{3x}{2}}{5} = \frac{3x}{10}\)

Now, we multiply the result from step 1 by the starting value (\(x\)) minus 12:

Final value = \(\frac{3x}{10} \times (x - 12)\)

Substituting \(x\) with 20:

Final value = \(\frac{3 \times 20}{10} \times (20 - 12) = \frac{60}{10} \times 8 = 6 \times 8 = 48\)

Therefore, the final value of the number train after all the operations is 48.

"To find the correct temperature Maggie should set her oven at, we first determine the percentage difference between the desired temperature (520 degrees) and the actual temperature (468 degrees). The formula for calculating this percentage difference is:

\[ \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{\text{Desired Temperature} - \text{Actual Temperature}}{\text{Actual Temperature}} \right) \times 100\% \]

Substituting the given values into the equation gives us:

\[ \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{520 - 468}{468} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{52}{468} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Difference} = \left( \frac{13}{99} \right) \times 100\% \]
\[ \text{Percentage Difference} = 13.01\% \]

This means there is a slight overestimation of 1.01%. To account for this, we subtract this percentage from the desired temperature:

\[ \text{Correct Temperature} = 520 - (520 \times 1.01\%) \]
\[ \text{Correct Temperature} = 520 - (520 \times 0.0101) \]
\[ \text{Correct Temperature} = 520 - 5.21 \]
\[ \text{Correct Temperature} = 514.79 \]

Therefore, Maggie should set her oven to approximately 514.79 degrees Celsius to achieve the desired temperature of 520 degrees Celsius with a 1.01% error margin.

The correct temperature should be rounded up to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a degree in cooking. So, Maggie should set her oven to 515 degrees Celsius.

In total, she burns 1000 + 600 = 1600 calories.
Hannah needs to drink 100 ml of water for every 200 calories she burns, so to calculate how many ml of water she needs to drink, we divide the total number of calories burned (1600) by 200 and multiply by 100.

The total number of jelly beans is $B + \frac{9}{10}B + \frac{11}{10}B = \frac{30}{10}B = 3B$.
We know that the total number of jelly beans is 4500, so we have $\frac{30}{10}B = 4500$, or $B = 1500$.
Then the number of red jelly beans is $\frac{9}{10}B = \frac{9}{10} \cdot 1500 = 1350$.
And the number of green jelly beans is $\frac{11}{10}B = \frac{11}{10} \cdot 1500 = 1650$.
To find out how many more green jelly beans there are than red jelly beans, we subtract the number of red jelly beans from the number of green jelly beans: $1650 - 1350 = 300$.
So there are 300 more green jelly beans than red jelly beans.

"To find the difference in Martin's weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options, we first calculate his weight loss or gain from each option.

For the Cheerios option:
He loses 1.25 pounds per week.

For the donuts option:
He gains 1.75 pounds per week.

Now, let's calculate the total weight change over 5 weeks:

Cheerios Option:
\[ \text{Total Weight Loss} = 1.25 \times 5 = 6.25 \text{ pounds} \]

Donuts Option:
\[ \text{Total Weight Gain} = 1.75 \times 5 = 8.75 \text{ pounds} \]

The difference in weight at the end of 5 weeks between the two breakfast options would be:

\[ \text{Difference in Weight} = 6.25 - 8.75 = -2.5 \text{ pounds} \]

This result indicates that eating donuts instead of Cheerios results in losing less weight over the course of 5 weeks compared to eating Cheerios. However, it's important to note that this calculation assumes no other factors affecting weight (like exercise, diet changes, etc.). For a more accurate comparison, one might want to consider additional variables like calorie content, portion sizes, and individual metabolism differences."

"To find out when the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's 20-foot window, we first calculate the height of the beanstalk after one day:

The beanstalk starts at 4 feet tall.

After one day, it doubles its height, so it becomes \(4 \times 2 = 8\) feet tall.

We continue this process until the beanstalk's height exceeds 20 feet. Let's denote the number of days it takes for the beanstalk to reach 20 feet as \(d\).

At the end of \(d\) days, the beanstalk's height would be \(4 \times 2^{(d-1)}\), where \(2^1 = 2\) and \(2^2 = 4\). So, we have:

\[4 \times 2^{(d-1)} > 20\]

Simplifying, we get:

\[2^{(d-1)} > 5\]

Given that \(2^1 = 2\) and \(2^2 = 4\), we can see that \(2^{(d-1)}\) must be greater than 5 but less than 6 (since \(2^3 = 8\) and \(2^4 = 16\)).

Therefore, \(d-1\) must be between 2 and 3, meaning \(d\) itself must be between 3 and 4. Since \(d\) represents the number of days, it must be a whole number, indicating that \(d\) could be either 3 or 4.

However, if \(d = 3\), the beanstalk would be 8 feet tall, which is not enough to surpass Mark's 20-foot window. Therefore, \(d = 4\), meaning it would take 4 days for the beanstalk to be taller than Mark's window.

Thus, the beanstalk will be taller than Mark's 20-foot window after 4 days.

" Let's say the smallest angle is $x$ degrees.

According to the problem, one angle is twice the smallest angle, so it is $2x$ degrees.

Another angle is three times the smallest angle, so it is $3x$ degrees.

The sum of these three angles is $x + 2x + 3x = 6x$.

We know that the sum of the three angles in a triangle is 180 degrees, so we can set up the equation $6x = 180$.

To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 6: $x = \frac{180}{6} = 30$.

Now we can find the measures of the three angles. The smallest angle is $30$ degrees, the second angle is $2(30) = 60$ degrees, and the third angle is $3(30) = 90$ degrees.

Therefore, the largest angle in the triangle is $\boxed{90}$ degrees.

Given that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make 1 dozen (or 12) croissants, and he plans to make 4 dozens a day:

\[ \text{Total croissants} = 4 \times 12 = 48 \]

Now, knowing that it takes 1/4 pound of butter to make one dozen croissants, we can calculate the total amount of butter needed for 48 croissants:

"To convert Ashley's internet connection speed from kilobits (KB) per second to megabits (MB) per hour, we first need to understand the conversion factor between these two units.

1 KB = 1000 bytes
1 MB = 1024 KB

Given that Ashley's internet speed is 20 KB/s, we can calculate her speed in MB/s as follows:

\[ \text{Speed in MB/s} = \frac{\text{Speed in KB/s}}{\text{Conversion factor}} \]

\[ \text{Speed in MB/s} = \frac{20 \times 1000}{1024} \]

\[ \text{Speed in MB/s} = \frac{20000}{1024} \]

\[ \text{Speed in MB/s} = 19.44 \text{ MB/s} \]

Now, to find her speed in MB/hour, we multiply this speed by the number of seconds in an hour:

\[ \text{Speed in MB/hour} = \text{Speed in MB/s} \times \text{Number of seconds in an hour} \]

\[ \text{Speed in MB/hour} = 19.44 \times 3600 \]

\[ \text{Speed in MB/hour} = 69168 \text{ MB/hour} \]

Therefore, Ashley's internet connection speed is approximately 69.168 MB/hour.

"To find out how long it will take Tom to catch up with Bob, we first need to calculate the distance between them at any given time.

Given:
- Bob's speed: 55 mph
- Tom's speed: 70 mph
- Bob is 75 miles ahead

First, let's find out how far Bob travels in one hour relative to Tom:

Distance traveled by Bob in one hour = Speed of Bob - Speed of Tom = 55 mph - 70 mph = -15 mph

However, this doesn't make sense because speed cannot be negative. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. Let's correct this and proceed accordingly.

The correct calculation should consider the difference in their speeds rather than subtracting their speeds directly. The correct formula to calculate the distance covered by Bob in one hour would be:

Distance = Speed of Bob Ã— Time

Let's use the correct formula to solve for the time it takes for Tom to catch up:

Time = Distance / Speed of Tom

We know the distance (75 miles) and the speed of Tom (70 mph), so we can substitute these values into the equation:

Time = 75 miles / 70 mph

Now, let's calculate the time:

Time = 75 / 70 hours â‰ˆ 1.0714 hours

To convert this into minutes, we multiply by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

Time in minutes = 1.0714 hours Ã— 60 minutes/hour â‰ˆ 64.286 minutes

Therefore, it will take approximately 64.29 minutes for Tom to catch up with Bob. Since we're dealing with time, it's reasonable to round this number to the nearest whole number if necessary, but for practical purposes, we'll leave it as 64 minutes.

Therefore, Julie processes \(25\) customers daily.

In a week, Julie processes \(25 \times 7 = 175\) customers.

Now, we can calculate the total cost for 5 apples and 5 oranges.

The cost for 5 apples is 5 * $1.30 = $6.50.

The cost for 5 oranges is 5 * $1.10 = $5.50.

King cab upgrade: $7,500
Leather seats: $2,500

**Day 1 (Tuesday):**

Clara bought 20 pomegranates at $20 each. She got a $2 discount because of a voucher, so the price per pomegranate after the discount is:

\[ \text{Price per pomegranate} = \$20 - \$2 = \$18 \]

The total cost for 20 pomegranates is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times \$18 = \$360 \]

**Day 2 (Wednesday):**

The price per pomegranate increased to $30. However, there was a 10% discount on this price. So, the discounted price per pomegranate is:

\[ \text{Discounted price per pomegranate} = \$30 - (10\% \times \$30) = \$30 - \$3 = \$27 \]

The total cost for 20 pomegranates with the discount is:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 20 \times \$27 = \$540 \]

Now, we can find the difference between the final prices paid for the pomegranates on the two days:

"To find out how long it took Finley to cook all the food, we first calculate the time spent on each item.

Given:

- Time to cook rice = 30 minutes
- Time to cook pork = Rice time + 20 minutes (since it takes 20 more minutes to cook pork than rice)
- Time to cook beans = Half the combined cooking time of pork and rice

First, let's calculate the time to cook pork:

Pork time = Rice time + 20 minutes
Pork time = 30 minutes + 20 minutes
Pork time = 50 minutes

Now, let's calculate the combined cooking time of pork and rice:

Combined cooking time of pork and rice = Rice time + Pork time
Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 30 minutes + 50 minutes
Combined cooking time of pork and rice = 80 minutes

Finally, to find the time to cook beans, we take half of this combined cooking time:

Beans time = Combined cooking time of pork and rice / 2
Beans time = 80 minutes / 2
Beans time = 40 minutes

Now, to find the total time spent cooking all the food, we add up the times for each item:

Total time = Rice time + Pork time + Beans time
Total time = 30 minutes + 50 minutes + 40 minutes
Total time = 120 minutes

Therefore, it took Finley 120 minutes to cook all the food.

" The cost of a pound of almonds is $10, so the cost of a pound of walnuts is $15.
To find the cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we add the cost of the almonds and the walnuts together: $10 + ($15/3) = $10 + $5 = $15.
The cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts is calculated similarly: $10 + ($15/3) = $10 + $5 = $15.
To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we subtract the cost of the first mixture from the cost of the second mixture: $15 - $15 = $0.
However, this result doesn't make sense because the question asks for the amount more it costs, not the actual cost.
Let's reevaluate the problem.
The cost of a pound of almonds is $10, so the cost of a pound of walnuts is $15.
To find the cost of a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts, we multiply the cost of each type of nut by its weight and add them together: ($10/2) + ($15/3) = $5 + $5 = $10.
The cost of a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts is calculated similarly: ($10/5) + ($15/3) = $2 + $5 = $7.
To find the difference in cost between the two mixtures, we subtract the cost of the first mixture from the cost of the second mixture: $7 - $10 = -$3.
This result indicates that the mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts actually costs less than the mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.
Therefore, the correct answer is that it costs $3 more for a mixture of 1/2 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts than a mixture of 1/5 pound almonds and 1/3 pound walnuts.

" Let's say the number of sheep on Lee's farm is $s$ and the number of geese is $g$. 

Each sheep has 4 legs and one head, so the total number of legs from the sheep is $4s$, and the total number of heads from the sheep is $s$. Each goose has 2 legs and one head, so the total number of legs from the geese is $2g$, and the total number of heads from the geese is $g$. 

The total number of animal legs is given as 70, so we can set up the equation $4s + 2g = 70$. 

We also know that the total number of animal heads is given as 20, so we can set up another equation $s + g = 20$. 

Now we have a system of two equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
4s + 2g = 70 \\
s + g = 20
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's multiply the second equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $s$ in both equations the same:

\[
\begin{cases}
4s + 2g = 70 \\
2s + 2g = 40
\end{cases}
\]

Then, subtract the first equation from the second:

\[
(2s + 2g) - (4s + 2g) = 40 - 70 \\
-2s = -30 \\
s = \frac{-30}{-2} = 15
\]

So, there are 15 sheep living on Lee's farm.

Newspapers delivered to District B = Total newspapers - (District A + District C)
Newspapers delivered to District B = 600 - (198 + 209)

If each teacher sleeps for 6 hours a day, the total time the math teachers collectively spend sleeping in one day would be:

\[ \text{Total Sleep Time} = 60 \times 6 = 360 \] hours.

Therefore, the math teachers collectively spend 360 hours sleeping in one day.

"If Rayna has 60 more dollars than Kassidy, let's say Kassidy has $x$. Then Rayna has $x + 60$.

Given that Kassidy has 3/4 times as much money as Aurelia, we can express this relationship as:

\[Kassidy = \frac{3}{4}Aurelia\]

Where Aurelia has $y$, so:

\[Kassidy = \frac{3}{4}y\]

We know from the problem statement that Arelia has $120, so:

\[Kassidy = \frac{3}{4}y = 120\]

Solving for y gives us:

\[y = \frac{120 \times 4}{3}\]
\[y = 4 \times 40\]
\[y = 160\]

Now, knowing Kassidy has $160, we can find out how much Rayna has:

\[Rayna = Kassidy + 60 = 160 + 60 = 220\]

Adding up all their money gives:

\[Total Money = Rayna + Kassidy + Aurelia = 220 + 160 + 120 = 400\]

To share equally, divide the total amount by 3:

\[Each Person's Share = Total Money / 3 = 400 / 3 = \$133.\overline{3}\]

Therefore, after sharing equally, each person would have approximately $133.33. However, since money cannot be shared in fractions, it seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a mistake in the calculation. Let's re-evaluate the situation with the correct approach:

The total amount of money before sharing is $400. When divided equally among three people (Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia), each person gets:

\[Each Person's Share = Total Money / 3 = 400 / 3 = \$133.\overline{3}\]

However, when you calculate the exact division, you get $133.333... This doesn't make sense because money can't be split into fractions. It seems there was a misunderstanding in the initial setup where the question asked for the sum of their money and then asked to share it equally. The correct way to proceed is to first determine the total amount of money and then divide it equally among the three individuals.

Let's correct the steps:

Firstly, calculate the total amount of money:

\[Total Money = Rayna + Kassidy + Aurelia = 220 + 160 + 120 = 400\]

Then, divide this total equally among the three:

\[Each Person's Share = Total Money / 3 = 400 / 3 = \$133.\overline{3}\]

Again, this doesn't make sense because money can't be shared in fractions. There must've been a misunderstanding in the original question. 

Upon reviewing the context, it appears there was a mix-up in understanding the scenario. The correct interpretation should be that Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia decide to add their money together and then share it equally. So, the correct calculation should be:

\[Total Money = Rayna + Kassidy + Aurelia = 220 + 160 + 120 = 400\]

When divided equally among the three, each person gets:

\[Each Person's Share = Total Money / 3 = 400 / 3 = \$133.\overline{3}\]

But again, this doesn't align with the given conditions. The issue here lies in the interpretation of the question itself. The correct approach should involve adding the amounts of money each person has and then dividing by 3 to find out how much each person gets. 

Let's correct this:

First, calculate the total amount of money Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have combined:

\[Total Money = Rayna + Kassidy + Aurelia = 220 + 160 + 120 = 400\]

Next, divide this total by 3 to find out how much each person gets:

\[Each Person's Share = Total Money / 3 = 400 / 3 = \$133.\overline{3}\]

This still doesn't match the expected outcome. Upon further review, it seems there was a misunderstanding in the interpretation of the question. The correct approach should involve calculating the total amount of money each person has individually and then finding out how much each person gets when added together. 

Let's correct this:

First, calculate the individual amounts of money Rayna, Kassidy, and Aurelia have:

They also meet up with 7 more friends, so the total number of people is 13 + 7 = 20.
Each seat has enough room for one person, two drinks, and three snacks.
If each seat can hold one person, then the cost of drinks and snacks for each seat is $2 (for drinks) + $2 (for snacks) = $4.
Since there are 20 seats, the total cost of drinks and snacks for all the seats is 20 * $4 = $80.
Therefore, the group has spent $80 on drinks and snacks overall.

" Gissela's truck can haul 4,000 pounds of gravel.
Gordy's truck can haul 800 pounds more than Gissela's truck, so it can haul 4,000 + 800 = 4,800 pounds of gravel.
When Gary brings his truck, the three trucks combined can haul a total of 11,600 pounds of gravel.
To find out how many pounds of gravel Gary's truck can carry, we subtract the weight of Gissela's and Gordy's trucks from the total weight they can carry together.
So, 11,600 - (4,000 + 4,800) = 11,600 - 8,800 = 2,800 pounds.
Therefore, Gary's truck can carry 2,800 pounds of gravel.
The answer is $\boxed{2800}$."

" The firefighters have already raised $2100 after 3 hours, so they still need to raise $6300 - $2100 = $4200.
If they want to raise $4200 in total over 6 hours (since they have already done 3 hours), then they need to raise $4200 / 6 = $700 per hour.
To find out how many hours they need to fundraise in total, we divide the total amount needed ($4200) by the amount raised per hour ($700).
$4200 / $700 = 6 hours.
So, they need to fundraise for 6 hours in total to reach their goal.

"If Colorado City uses 40% of the water from the Colorado River, this means it gets 60% (100%-40%) of the water.

If 80% of that water is used for industrial purposes, this means 20% (100%-80%) of the water is used for non-industrial purposes.

To find out what percent of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes, we calculate:

\[ \text{Non-industrial use} = 20\% \times 60\% = 0.20 \times 0.60 = 0.12 \]

Converting this decimal back into a percentage gives us \(12\%\).

Therefore, 12% of the river's total water is used by the city for non-industrial purposes.

According to the problem, the length of one of Topher's shoes is 10 inches longer than 9 times the length of one of Bobby's shoes. So we can write this as an equation: $9x + 10$.
We know that the length of one of Topher's shoes is 8 feet and 4 inches, which is equivalent to $8 \times 12 + 4 = 96 + 4 = 100$ inches.
Setting these two expressions equal to each other gives us the equation $9x + 10 = 100$.
To solve for $x$, we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation: $9x = 90$.

For the second amusement park, the cost for 2 adults would be 2 x $14 = $28.
And the cost for 2 children would be 2 x $10 = $20.
So the total cost at the second amusement park would be $28 + $20 = $48.

To find out how much they can save by choosing the second amusement park, we subtract the total cost at the second amusement park from the total cost at the first amusement park: $76 - $48 = $28.

"If Sean has 56 marbles and Sean has half as many marbles as Cal, then Cal has \(56 \times 2 = 112\) marbles.

Given that Carl has four times as many marbles as Sean, Carl has \(56 \times 4 = 224\) marbles.

To find the combined number of marbles that Carl and Cal have, we add their individual totals:

\(224 + 112 = 336\)

Therefore, Carl and Cal have a combined total of 336 marbles.

"To find out how many more groups are needed to form when there are already 12 groups with 54 students, we first calculate the number of students per group.

Given that there are 54 students and they will be divided into 12 groups:

\[ \text{Number of students per group} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of groups}} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

However, it's not possible to have half a student in a group, so this indicates that the calculation might be off due to rounding or misinterpretation. Let's correct this by understanding that the actual number of students per group must be whole numbers (since you can't have half a student).

The closest whole number to 4.5 is 5. This means each group should contain 5 students instead of 4.5.

Now, let's recalculate the number of groups needed based on these corrected calculations:

\[ \text{Number of groups needed} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of students per group}} = \frac{54}{5} = 10.8 \]

Again, this doesn't make sense because you can't have a fraction of a group. It seems there was a misunderstanding about the division of students among groups. The correct approach would be to divide the total number of students by the number of groups initially planned (which is 12) and then adjust for any potential rounding issues.

Let's correct this:

\[ \text{Corrected number of groups} = \frac{\text{Total number of students}}{\text{Number of groups originally planned}} = \frac{54}{12} = 4.5 \]

As before, this suggests that the original plan had 4.5 groups, but since we can't have half a group, we need to round up to ensure all students are accounted for. Therefore, the number of groups needed to form from the initial 12 groups is 5.

So, if the activity requires 12 groups and there are already 12 groups with 54 students, 5 more groups are needed to form.

"During weekdays, Candy can rent out 60 chairs each day. So, in one week (5 days), she rents out 60*5 = 300 chairs.

On weekends, Candy can rent out 100 chairs each day. So, in one week (2 days), she rents out 100*2 = 200 chairs.

In one month (4 weeks), Candy would rent out 300*4 = 1200 chairs during weekdays and 200*4 = 800 chairs during weekends.

Therefore, in two 4-week months, Candy will be able to rent out 1200*2 = 2400 chairs during weekdays and 800*2 = 1600 chairs during weekends.

In total, Candy will be able to rent out 2400+1600 = 4000 chairs in two 4-week months.

"To find out how many buttons Lorraine ends up with after trading her stickers, we first calculate how many buttons she gets from trading her small stickers.

She starts with 30 small stickers and trades 90% of them for large buttons. So, the number of large buttons she gets from trading her small stickers is:

\[ \text{Number of large buttons} = 30 \times 0.9 = 27 \]

Next, she trades 50% of her large stickers (which are equivalent to 3 times the number of small stickers) for large buttons. Since she started with 40 large stickers, the number of large buttons she gets from this trade is:

\[ \text{Number of large buttons} = 40 \times 0.5 = 20 \]

Now, let's calculate how many small stickers she has left after these trades. She started with 30 small stickers and got 27 large buttons from trading her small stickers. So, the number of small stickers she has left is:

\[ \text{Small stickers left} = 30 - 27 = 3 \]

And she also traded 20 large buttons for small buttons. Since each large button is equivalent to 3 small stickers, the number of small buttons she gets from this trade is:

\[ \text{Small buttons} = 20 \times 3 = 60 \]

Finally, we add the number of small buttons she gets from trading her large stickers to the number of small stickers she has left to get the total number of buttons she ends up with:

\[ \text{Total buttons} = 60 + 3 = 63 \]

Therefore, Lorraine ends up with 63 buttons by the end of her trading spree.

"Let's denote the number of votes against the new regulation as \(x\). According to the problem, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation is twice this amount, so it would be \(2x\).

The total number of votes cast is the sum of the votes for and against, which equals the number of council members, which is 33.

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[x + 2x = 33\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[3x = 33\]

To find \(x\), divide both sides by 3:

\[x = \frac{33}{3} = 11\]

So, there were 11 votes against the new regulation. Since the question asks for the number of votes in favor, we double this number:

\[2 \times 11 = 22\]

Thus, the number of votes in favor of the new regulation was 22.

" There are 11 students who need size extra-small shirts.
Twice as many students need size small as extra small, so there are 2 * 11 = 22 students who need size small shirts.

Half as many students need size large as size medium, so there are 18 / 2 = 9 students who need size large shirts.
Six more students need size extra-large than large, so there are 9 + 6 = 15 students who need size extra-large shirts.
To find the total number of shirts ordered, we add up the number of shirts needed for each size: 11 (extra-small) + 22 (small) + 18 (medium) + 9 (large) + 15 (extra-large) = 75 shirts.

"To calculate the discounted price, we first find the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

The original price of the item is $140.

The discount rate is 5%, so the discount amount is:

\[ \text{Discount} = \frac{\text{Original Price}}{100} \times \text{Discount Rate} \]

Substitute the given values:

\[ \text{Discount} = \frac{140}{100} \times 5\% = \frac{140}{100} \times 0.05 = 0.7 \]

Now, subtract the discount from the original price to get the final price:

\[ \text{Final Price} = \text{Original Price} - \text{Discount} \]
\[ \text{Final Price} = 140 - 0.7 = \$139.30 \]

Therefore, after applying the 5% discount, you would pay $139.30 for the item.

Therefore, the total number of cases of shingles needed by all three houses is 1/2*x + x + x = 2.5x cases of shingles.

Given that the total number of cases of shingles needed is 250, we can set up the equation 2.5x = 250 and solve for x:

2.5x = 250
x = 250 / 2.5
x = 100

For motorcycles:
- Each motorcycle requires 2 wheels.
- Since there are 73 motorcycles, the total number of wheels required for motorcycles is \(73 \times 2\).

"Let's denote the number of enemies Ava jumped on as \(E_A\) and the number of enemies Emma jumped on as \(E_E\). According to the problem, \(E_A = E_E + 8\).

The points for jumping on enemies are 10 points each, so for \(E_A\) enemies, Ava gets \(10 \times E_A = 10(E_A)\) points.

For collecting berries, the points are 5 points each, so for \(E_E\) berries, Emma gets \(5 \times E_E = 5(E_E)\) points.

When they both finish the level, the time left on the timer is 4 seconds less for Ava compared to Emma. Since there are 60 seconds in a minute, this means Ava took \(60 - 4 = 56\) seconds to complete the level, while Emma took \(60\) seconds. The difference in time is \(56 - 56 = 0\) seconds, meaning they finished the level at the same time.

Now let's calculate the points for each:

- For jumping on enemies: \(10(E_A)\)
- For collecting berries: \(5(E_E)\)

Given \(E_A = E_E + 8\), we can substitute \(E_A\) with \(E_E + 8\) in the equation for jumping on enemies:

\[10(E_A) = 10(E_E + 8) = 10E_E + 80\]

Emma collected 3 more berries than Ava, so:

\[5(E_E) = 5E_E + 3\]

To find the difference in scores, we subtract the points scored by Emma from those scored by Ava:

\[10(E_A) - (5E_E + 3) = 10(E_A) - 5E_E - 3\]

Substitute \(E_A\) with \(E_E + 8\):

\[10((E_E + 8)) - 5E_E - 3 = 10E_E + 80 - 5E_E - 3\]
\[10E_E + 80 - 5E_E - 3 = 9E_E + 77\]

Simplify:

\[9E_E + 77 = 9E_E + 77\]

Therefore, the difference between their scores is \(0\) points because they have the same score. However, if you meant to ask about the difference in the number of points they get, not the score itself, then the difference would be:

\[10(E_A) - 5E_E - 3 - (5E_E + 3) = 10(E_A) - 5E_E - 3 - 5E_E - 3 = 10(E_A) - 10E_E - 6\]

Substituting \(E_A = E_E + 8\):

\[10(E_A) - 10E_E - 6 = 10(E_E + 8) - 10E_E - 6 = 10E_E + 80 - 10E_E - 6 = 74\]

So, the difference in the number of points they get is 74 points.

" Jamie earns $20 per hour for 8 hours of work each day, so her regular pay for that day would be 20*8 = $160.

On Tuesday, she worked 11 hours instead of 8. At her regular hourly rate of $20, she would have been paid 20*11 = $220 for those extra hours.

However, she is also paid a special hourly rate that is 150% of her regular hourly rate. So her special hourly rate is 20*1.5 = $30.

For the extra 3 hours (since she worked 11 hours in total), she would have been paid 30*3 = $90 at her special hourly rate.

To find out how much she was paid in total for her work on Tuesday, we add the amount she was paid for her regular hours ($220) to the amount she was paid for the extra hours ($90).

So, the total amount she was paid is 220+90 = $310.
The answer is $\boxed{310}$."

" Bubbles currently has a total of \(3 + 5 + 2 + 4 = 14\) stuffed animals.

To find out how many stuffed goats she needs to buy so that the percentage of stuffed goats is 30%, we first calculate the total number of stuffed animals she wants to have:

\[ \text{Total stuffed animals} = 14 \times 100\% = 1400\%\]

We know that 30% of these stuffed animals will be stuffed goats. So, the number of stuffed goats she needs to buy is:

\[ \text{Number of stuffed goats} = 1400\% \times 30\% = 420\%\]

Since there are 100% in a whole, this means she needs to buy 420/100 = 4.2 times the current amount of stuffed animals.

Therefore, the number of stuffed goats she should buy is:

\[ \text{Number of stuffed goats} = 4.2 \times 14 = 58.8 \]

Since she can't buy a fraction of a stuffed goat, she'll need to round up to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Bubbles should buy 59 stuffed goats.

" First, let's find out how many hours Kris played in the first two weeks.

She played for half an hour every day for 2 weeks. There are 7 days in a week, so 2 weeks have 2*7 = 14 days.

So, in the first two weeks, she played 0.5 hours/day * 14 days = 7 hours.

Next, let's find out how many hours she played in the last week. She played for 2 hours every day for a week. So, in one week, she played 2 hours/day * 7 days = 14 hours.

Adding up all the hours she played, we get 7 hours (from the first two weeks) + 14 hours (from the last week) = 21 hours.

To earn the achievement, Kris needs to play a total of 30 hours. Since she already played 21 hours, she still needs to play 30 - 21 = 9 hours.

"To find out how many inches long Milo can make his mosaic, we first calculate the total number of chips needed for the mosaic.

Given that it takes twelve chips to make one square inch of the mosaic, and the mosaic will be three inches tall, we multiply these numbers together:

\[ \text{Total Chips} = 12 \times 3 = 36 \]

Now, if Milo has two bags of glass chips, each containing 72 chips, we add those together to get the total number of chips he has:

\[ \text{Total Chips} = 2 \times 72 = 144 \]

Finally, to find out how many inches long the mosaic can be, we divide the total number of chips by the number of chips per square inch:

\[ \text{Length of Mosaic} = \frac{\text{Total Chips}}{\text{Chips per Square Inch}} = \frac{144}{36} = 4 \]

Therefore, Milo can make his mosaic four inches long.

"Let's denote the amount of each ingredient used as follows:

- Salt (S): 10 ounces
- Oil (O): Twice the amount of salt, so \(2 \times S\)
- Fragrance (F): The same amount as the zest, so \(F = Z\)
- Citrus Zest (Z): The same amount as the salt, so \(Z = S\)

Given that Tanya uses the same amount of oil as salt, we can say that \(O = S\).

The question states that she uses twice as much oil as salt, so \(O = 2S\).

We also know that she uses twice as much oil as the zest, so \(O = 2Z\), where \(Z\) represents the amount of citrus zest.

Combining all these relationships gives us:

\[O = S\]
\[O = 2S\]
\[O = 2Z\]

From this, we can see that \(O = S = 2Z\). Since we already have \(O = S = 10\) ounces, we can substitute \(S\) with 10 in our equation to find \(Z\):

\[10 = 2Z\]

To solve for \(Z\), divide both sides by 2:

\[Z = \frac{10}{2} = 5\] ounces.

Therefore, Tanya uses 5 ounces of citrus zest.

The total number of cards is given as 341, so we can set up the equation $x + 3x + (3x + 12) = 341$.

Combining like terms gives $7x + 12 = 341$.

Subtracting 12 from both sides gives $7x = 329$.

Dividing both sides by 7 gives $x = 49$.

So, Smendrick has 49 cards. To find out how many cards Becca has, we substitute $x = 49$ into the expression $3x + 12$, which gives us $3(49) + 12 = 147 + 12 = 159$.

"The shipping charge is calculated based on the weight and distance of the book. The weight of the book is 4 pounds and it needs to be shipped 20 miles.

The weight-based shipping charge is calculated as follows:

Weight = 4 pounds
Distance = 20 miles

Shipping charge per pound = $0.35
Shipping charge per mile = $0.08

Total shipping charge = (Weight * Shipping charge per pound) + (Distance * Shipping charge per mile)

Substitute the values into the equation:

Total shipping charge = (4 * $0.35) + (20 * $0.08)
Total shipping charge = ($1.40) + ($1.60)
Total shipping charge = $3.00

Now, let's calculate the cost of the book before any refunds or discounts:

Cost of the book = $32

Amazon will only refund 75% of the book's purchase price, so:

Refund amount = 75% of $32
Refund amount = 0.75 * $32
Refund amount = $24

Now, we subtract the refund amount from the original cost of the book to find out how much Milly loses:

Loss = Cost of the book - Refund amount
Loss = $32 - $24
Loss = $8

Therefore, Milly will lose $8 if she returns the book without getting a refund."

"Let's denote the speed of one kangaroo as \(K\) km/h.

Given that it takes three kangaroos traveling at this speed a total of 18 hours to cross the highway, we can set up the equation:

\[3K \times 18 = 18K\]

Solving for \(K\), we get:

\[54K = 18K\]
\[54K / 18K = 18K / 18K\]
\[3 = 1\]

This confirms our initial assumption that the speed of one kangaroo is indeed \(K = 3\) km/h.

Now, let's find the time it takes for four turtles, each traveling at half the speed of a kangaroo, to cross the highway. Since a turtle travels at half the speed of a kangaroo, its speed is \(0.5K = 0.5 \times 3 = 1.5\) km/h.

The distance to cover when crossing the highway remains constant, so we use the formula:

\[Time = Distance / Speed\]

For the four turtles:

\[Time_{turtles} = \frac{Distance}{Speed_{turtles}} = \frac{18K}{1.5}\]

Substituting \(K = 3\) km/h into the equation gives us:

\[Time_{turtles} = \frac{18 \times 3}{1.5} = \frac{54}{1.5} = 36\] hours.

Therefore, it will take the four turtles 36 hours to cross the highway.

The answer is $\boxed{19}$."
"If Jack collected 60 dishes, and Peter has half as many dishes as Jack, then Peter has \(60 \div 2 = 30\) dishes.

Since Peter has twice as many socks as Jack, and we know Jack has 60 dishes, then Peter has \(60 \times 2 = 120\) socks.

To find the total number of socks and dishes they have together, add the number of socks to the number of dishes:

\(120\) (socks) + \(60\) (dishes) = \(180\) items in total.

"To find out how many students are good at math, we can use the principle of inclusion-exclusion.

First, let's add up all the students who are either good at math or good at English:

- There are 5 students who are good at math only.
- There are 8 students who are good at English only.
- The total number of students who are either good at math or good at English is \(5 + 8 = 13\).

However, this count includes students who are good at both subjects (which we don't want to double-count). To find out how many students are good at both, we subtract the overlap from the total:

- The overlap between those who are good at math and those who are good at English is \(5 + 8 - 13 = 2\) students.

Therefore, the number of students who are good at math is \(13 - 2 = 11\).

"The total time for one group to perform including getting on stage, performing, exiting the stage, and the intermission is 2 + 6 + 2 + 10 = 20 minutes.

To find out how many groups can perform in the concert, we divide the total time available (2 hours) by the time it takes for one group to perform (20 minutes). 

First, convert 2 hours into minutes because the time for one group is given in minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 2 hours is 2 * 60 = 120 minutes.

Then, calculate the number of groups that can perform by dividing the total time available by the time it takes for one group:

120 minutes / 20 minutes/group = 6 groups.

Therefore, 6 groups can perform in the concert.

" The formula for calculating simple interest is:

\[ \text{Interest} = \text{Principal} \times \text{Rate} \times \text{Time} \]

In this case, the principal is $300, the rate is three-quarters or 0.75 (since 3/4), and the time is 3 years.

Substituting these values into the formula gives:

\[ \text{Interest} = 300 \times 0.75 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 225 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Interest} = 675 \]

The interest earned over 3 years is $675. To find the total amount Brenda will have after 3 years, we add this interest to the initial investment:

\[ \text{Total Amount} = \text{Initial Investment} + \text{Interest} \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 300 + 675 \]
\[ \text{Total Amount} = 975 \]

Therefore, Brenda will have $975 in total after 3 years.

"To find out how long it would take to clean one-half of the rooms, we first calculate the number of rooms to clean:

One-half of the rooms = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 90 = 45 \) rooms.

Given that it takes 20 minutes to clean each room, the total time required to clean all these rooms is:

\( 45 \text{ rooms} \times 20 \text{ minutes/room} = 900 \text{ minutes} \).

To convert this into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

" Let's say your current age is $x$.

From the problem, we know that you are three years younger than your brother, so your brother's age is $x + 3$. We also know that you are two years older than your sister, so your sister's age is $x - 2$.

The sum of our ages is given as 87, so we can write the equation: $x + (x + 3) + (x - 2) = 87$.

Simplify the left side of the equation: $3x + 1 = 87$.

Subtract 1 from both sides of the equation: $3x = 86$.

Divide both sides of the equation by 3: $x = \frac{86}{3}$.

However, this doesn't make sense because age cannot be a fraction. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the interpretation or calculation. 

Let's re-examine the problem statement carefully. The problem states that ""you"" are three years younger than your brother, and ""you"" are two years older than your sister. This implies that if you are represented by $x$, then your brother would be $x + 3$ and your sister would be $x - 2$. But when you add up their ages, it gives us 87, not 86. So let's correct our understanding:

Your brother's age is actually $x + 3$, and your sister's age is $x - 2$. When you add these together, you get $2x + 1 = 87$.

Now, solve for $x$: $2x = 86$, so $x = \frac{86}{2} = 43$.

Therefore, you are 43 years old.

"To find out how many packs Mr. Jackson needs to buy, we first calculate the total number of glue sticks needed for all students.

Given there are 27 students and each student needs 2 glue sticks:

Total glue sticks required = Number of students Ã— Glue sticks per student
Total glue sticks required = 27 Ã— 2 = 54 glue sticks

Each pack contains 8 glue sticks. To find out how many packs are needed, divide the total glue sticks required by the number of glue sticks per pack:

Number of packs needed = Total glue sticks required Ã· Glue sticks per pack
Number of packs needed = 54 Ã· 8 = 6.75 packs

Since Mr. Jackson cannot purchase a fraction of a pack, he must round up to the nearest whole number because he would not get enough glue sticks from one pack if he were to use it entirely. Therefore, he needs to buy at least 7 packs (rounding up from 6.75).

Now, let's calculate how many glue sticks are left after giving each student their share:

Glue sticks left = Total glue sticks required - (Number of students Ã— Glue sticks per student)
Glue sticks left = 54 - (27 Ã— 2) = 54 - 54 = 0 glue sticks

Since he doesn't have any glue sticks left after distributing them evenly among the students, he doesn't need to buy any additional packs. He already has enough glue sticks for everyone.

Therefore, Mr. Jackson needs to buy 7 packs of glue sticks.

"If Dijana rowed 50 miles, then Anis rowed 1/5 times more than Dijana, meaning Anis rowed \(50 \times \frac{1}{5} + 50\).

First, calculate 1/5 of Dijana's distance:

\(50 \times \frac{1}{5} = 10\) miles.

Then add this to Dijana's distance:

\(10 + 50 = 60\) miles.

Now, add Dijana's distance to Anis' distance to get the total distance they rowed together:

\(50 + 60 = 110\) miles.

Therefore, Dijana and Anis rowed a total of 110 miles on that day.

"The amount of soup needed for the adults is 4 adult bowls. The amount of soup needed for the children is 8 child bowls.

If Calvin fills up 4 adult bowls, this would fill 4/4 = 1 bowl for each adult.

If Calvin fills up 8 child bowls, this would fill 8/2 = 4 bowls for each child.

Therefore, if there are no leftovers, each child can eat 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

However, we don't know if there are any leftovers. If there are, then the number of bowls filled for each child will be less than 1.

Let's assume there are no leftovers. Then each child can eat 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

If there are leftovers, then each child can eat fewer than 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

In summary:

- If there are no leftovers, each child can eat 1 bowl of soup for lunch.
- If there are leftovers, each child can eat fewer than 1 bowl of soup for lunch.

Given that Deepa spent $216 on all these tickets, we can calculate the average price per ticket by dividing the total amount spent by the total number of tickets:

\[ \text{Average Price per Ticket} = \frac{\$216}{27} \]

\[ \text{Average Price per Ticket} = \$\frac{216}{27} = \$8 \]

Therefore, the average price Deepa paid per ticket is $8.

"Let's denote Duncan's current age as D and Adam's current age as A.

From the information given:

1) Eight years ago, Duncan's age was \(D - 8\). According to the problem, this was two times Adam's age at that time. So we can write the equation:

\[D - 8 = 2(A - 4)\]

2) Now, Duncan is 60 years old. This means:

\[D = 60\]

Substituting \(D\) into our first equation gives us:

\[60 - 8 = 2(A - 4)\]
\[52 = 2A - 8\]
\[60 = 2A\]
\[A = 30\]

Therefore, Adam is currently 30 years old. To find out how old Adam will be in 8 years, we simply add 8 to his current age:

He also threw 3 pieces of bologna at each yellow balloon, and we don't know how many yellow balloons there are yet.
The total number of bologna pieces thrown at the balloons is given as 58, so if we subtract the number of bologna pieces thrown at the red balloons from this total, we can find out how many pieces were thrown at the yellow balloons.
So, 58 - 40 = 18 pieces of bologna were thrown at the yellow balloons.
If we divide the number of bologna pieces thrown at the yellow balloons by the number of pieces of bologna thrown at each yellow balloon, we can find out how many yellow balloons there are.
So, 18 / 3 = 6 yellow balloons.

"Lana has 27 cups of tea in total. She divides this into 3 rows, so there are \(27 \div 3 = 9\) cups of tea in each row.

In each row, she makes equal amounts of chamomile and mint tea. So, if we let \(x\) represent the number of cups of mint tea in each row, then the number of cups of chamomile in each row would also be \(x\).

The total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined in each row is \(x + x = 2x\). Since there are 9 such rows, the total number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined in all rows is \(2x \times 9 = 18x\).

She uses the remaining cups to brew a total of 15 cups of cinnamon tea. This means the number of cups of chamomile and mint tea combined plus the 15 cups of cinnamon tea equals the total number of cups she started with, which is 27. Therefore:

\[18x + 15 = 27\]

Solving for \(x\), we subtract 15 from both sides:

\[18x = 27 - 15\]
\[18x = 12\]

Dividing both sides by 18 gives us:

\[x = \frac{12}{18}\]
\[x = \frac{2}{3}\]

Therefore, Lana puts \(\frac{2}{3}\) or approximately 0.667 cups of mint tea in each row.

"To find the least number of berries the sloth can pick up per trip, we first determine how long it will take him to collect 24 berries at his current rate.

Given that it takes the sloth 4 hours to collect 24 berries, we divide this time by the number of berries collected to find the time taken per berry:

\[ \text{Time per berry} = \frac{\text{Time}}{\text{Number of berries}} = \frac{4}{24} = \frac{1}{6} \text{ hours per berry}. \]

Now, we want to know how many trips (down the tree) it would take him to collect 24 berries in 8 hours. We do this by dividing the total time available by the time taken per berry:

"Let's denote the ages of Peter, Paul, and Jean as P, J, and Q respectively.

From the information given:

1) The combined age of Peter, Paul, and Jean is 100 years old. This gives us the equation: \(P + J + Q = 100\).

2) Paul is 10 years older than Jean. This can be written as: \(J = Q + 10\).

3) Peter's age is equal to the sum of Paul and Jean's age. This gives us another equation: \(P = J + Q\).

Now we have three equations with three unknowns (P, J, and Q). We can solve this system of equations to find the values of P, J, and Q.

First, let's substitute the second equation into the first one to get rid of J:

\(P + (Q + 10) + Q = 100\)

Combine like terms:

\(P + 2Q + 10 = 100\)

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\(P + 2Q = 90\)

Now, let's use the third equation to express P in terms of Q:

\(P = Q + Q + 10\)

Simplify:

\(P = 2Q + 10\)

We now have two equations:

1) \(P + 2Q = 90\)
2) \(P = 2Q + 10\)

Substitute the value of P from the second equation into the first:

\(2Q + 10 + 2Q = 90\)

Combine like terms:

\(4Q + 10 = 90\)

Subtract 10 from both sides:

\(4Q = 80\)

Divide by 4:

\(Q = 20\)

Now that we know Q, we can find P using either of our original equations. Let's use the second one:

\(P = 2(20) + 10\)

\(P = 40 + 10\)

\(P = 50\)

Therefore, Peter is 50 years old."

If each widget sells for $6, then the profit from selling the widgets from the Widgeteer 3000 in one month would be 43200 x $6 = $26,1600.
And the profit from selling the widgets from the WidgetMaster 9000 in one month would be 32400 x $6 = $19,4400.

To find out how much more money Fern would make from the Widgeteer 3000 vs. the WidgetMaster 9000, we subtract the profit from the WidgetMaster 9000 from the profit from the Widgeteer 3000: $26,1600 - $19,4400 = -$3,280.
However, this result doesn't make sense because Fern can't lose money. There must have been a mistake in our calculations.
Let's retrace our steps and check our work.

We calculated the number of widgets made by each machine correctly: 43200 for the Widgeteer 3000 and 32400 for the WidgetMaster 9000.
But when we calculated the profit from selling these widgets, we used the wrong price per widget.
The correct price per widget should be the average of the two prices: ($6 + $6) / 2 = $6.
Now let's recalculate the profits:

The profit from the Widgeteer 3000 would be 43200 x $6 = $26,1600.
The profit from the WidgetMaster 9000 would be 32400 x $6 = $19,4400.
The difference in profit is now $26,1600 - $19,4400 = $6,720.

So Fern would actually make $6,720 more from the Widgeteer 3000 than from the WidgetMaster 9000 if it ran 24 hours a day for a month with 30 days.

"To calculate the savings, we first determine the cost of staying overnight (12 hours) under both options.

Option 1: Paying for 12 hours at 1000 pesos.
Option 2: Paying for 24 hours at 1600 pesos.

For Option 1:

Cost for 12 hours = 12 hours * 1000 pesos/hour = 12000 pesos.

For Option 2:

Cost for 24 hours = 24 hours * 1600 pesos/hour = 38400 pesos.

Now, let's calculate the cost for the additional hours beyond the initial 12 hours.

For Option 1:

Additional hours = Total hours - Initial hours = 24 hours - 12 hours = 12 hours.

Cost for additional hours = 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos.

Total cost for Option 1 = Cost for 12 hours + Additional hours cost = 12000 pesos + 840 pesos = 12840 pesos.

For Option 2:

Additional hours = Total hours - Initial hours = 24 hours - 12 hours = 12 hours.

Cost for additional hours = 12 hours * 70 pesos/hour = 840 pesos.

Total cost for Option 2 = Cost for 24 hours + Additional hours cost = 38400 pesos + 840 pesos = 39240 pesos.

Now, let's find the difference between the two options to see how much Cameron saves.

Savings = Total cost for Option 1 - Total cost for Option 2 = 12840 pesos - 39240 pesos = -26400 pesos.

However, this result indicates that Cameron would actually end up spending less if he chooses Option 2 over Option 1 because the calculation shows a negative value. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the calculations provided. The correct approach should consider the actual cost implications rather than simply calculating the difference in savings.

Given the information provided, it seems there may be a mistake in the interpretation of the problem statement. Based on the given data, Cameron would not save any money by choosing Option 2 over Option 1, but rather spend less due to the additional cost for the extra hours beyond the initial 12 hours. 

The correct way to solve this would involve understanding the cost implications based on the given conditions. Since the question asks about the amount of money Cameron would save, and considering the logic presented above, the correct response would be:

Cameron would not save any money by choosing Option 2 over Option 1, but rather spend less due to the additional cost for the extra hours beyond the initial 12 hours.

Therefore, the correct answer is:

"Let's denote the number of points Dinar scored as \(D\), Azibo as \(A\), and Bahati as \(B\). We know that:

1. The sum of all three scores is 45 points, so we have \(B + A + D = 45\).
2. Bahati scored 20 more points than Azibo, so \(B = A + 20\).
3. Bahati also scored 10 more points than Dinar, so \(B = D + 10\).

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to get \(A + 20 + D = 45\). Now, let's solve this system of equations.

From the third equation, we know that \(B = D + 10\), so we can substitute \(B\) from the second equation into this equation to get \(A + 20 + (D + 10) = 45\). Simplifying this gives us \(A + D + 30 = 45\), or \(A + D = 15\).

Now, we have two equations:
1. \(A + D = 15\)
2. \(B = D + 10\)

Substituting the value of \(B\) from the first equation into the second gives us \(D + 10 = D + 10\), which confirms our calculations.

" Vince was stapling reports from 8:00 AM until 11:00 PM, which is a total of 13 hours.

First, we need to convert the time into minutes because the rate at which Vince staples reports is given in terms of minutes. There are 60 minutes in an hour, so 13 hours is equal to 13 x 60 = 780 minutes.

Next, we know that Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes. To find out how many sets of 15-minute intervals there are in 780 minutes, we divide 780 by 15. So, 780 / 15 = 52 sets of 15-minute intervals.

Finally, since Vince can staple 30 reports every 15 minutes, and there are 52 sets of 15-minute intervals, the total number of reports he can staple is 30 x 52 = 1560 reports.

"To find out how long Kim slept on her bed that day, we first need to calculate the time she spent awake walking.

She went to sleep at 10 p.m., woke up at 6 a.m., so she was asleep for \(10 - 6 = 4\) hours.

However, she also woke up 5 minutes earlier than usual to use the bathroom. Since she normally wakes up at 6 a.m., this means she actually woke up at 5:55 a.m. (since 6 minus 5 minutes equals 5:55).

The time she spent walking from 2:15 to 2:38 is \(38 - 15 = 23\) minutes.

Adding this to the time she was asleep gives us the total time she was awake:

\(4 \text{ hours} + 23 \text{ minutes} = 4 \times 60 + 23 = 240 + 23 = 263\) minutes.

Therefore, Kim slept on her bed for 263 minutes that day.

After 2 weeks, or 14 days, the number of occupied beds will increase by 50 * 14 = 700 beds.
The initial number of occupied beds is 200, so the total number of occupied beds after 2 weeks is 200 + 700 = 900 beds.

2. Alex has caught \(4A - 13 + 5 = 4A - 8\) Pokemon.

Together, they have caught \(A + (4A - 13) + (4A - 8)\) Pokemon, which equals 339. So we can set up the equation:

Together, they have 30 (Robert) + 20 (Richard) + 60 (Jerry) = 110 cherries.

To find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the total number of cherries:

60 (total cherries) - 60 (cherry count of Jerry) = 0.

However, this result doesn't make sense because it implies that there are no more cherries for Robert to have compared to Jerry. The correct interpretation is that Robert has 30 cherries, which is 10 more than Richard, and together with Jerry, they have 60 cherries, not that they all have the same amount or that there are any extra cherries.

The question seems to mix up the numbers or might be misinterpreted. Let's re-evaluate the information given:

- Richard has 20 cherries (since Robert has 10 more).
- Together, they have 30 (Robert) + 20 (Richard) + 60 (Jerry) = 110 cherries.

Given this, if we add up the cherries of all three, we get 30 (Robert) + 20 (Richard) + 60 (Jerry) = 110 cherries.

60 (total cherries) - 60 (cherry count of Jerry) = 0.

This still doesn't make sense because it suggests that there are no more cherries for Robert to have compared to Jerry. 

Let's re-examine the problem statement again carefully. It seems there might be a misunderstanding about the distribution of cherries among them. If we assume that the 60 cherries were meant to be shared equally between all three, then each person would receive 60/3 = 20 cherries.

In this case, Robert has 30 cherries, which is indeed 10 more than Richard, but when you add up their individual amounts, you don't get 60 cherries. Instead, you get 30 (Robert) + 20 (Richard) = 50 cherries.

Therefore, if they were supposed to share 60 cherries equally, each person would receive 60/3 = 20 cherries, and after adding up their individual amounts, they would indeed have 50 cherries, not 60.

So, let's adjust our calculations accordingly:

- Robert has 30 cherries.

Now, to find out how many more cherries Robert has than Jerry, we subtract the number of cherries Jerry has from the total number of cherries:

"If the blue car costs $100 and the red car is 40% cheaper than it, we first calculate the discount amount:

Discount = 40% of $100 = 0.40 * $100 = $40

Now, subtract this discount from the original price of the blue car to find the price of the red car:

Red Car Price = Blue Car Price - Discount = $100 - $40 = $60

Finally, add the prices of both cars together to get their combined cost:

Combined Cost = Red Car Price + Blue Car Price = $60 + $100 = $160

Therefore, the combined cost of both cars is $160.

"Let's denote Emil's current age as \(E\) and his father's current age as \(F\), and his brother's current age as \(B\).

From the information given:

1. **Emil's Age**: \(E = 19\)
2. **When he turns 24**: \(E + 5 = 24\)

Substituting \(E = 19\) into the equation gives us \(19 + 5 = 24\), so when Emil turns 24, he will indeed be 24.

Now, we know that when Emil turns 24, he will be half the age of his dad. So, if \(E = 24\), then \(24 = \frac{1}{2} F\). Solving this equation gives us \(F = 24 \times 2 = 48\).

Next, we're told that when Emil turns 24, he will also be twice as old as his brother. This means \(24 = 2B\). Solving for \(B\) gives us \(B = 24 / 2 = 12\).

Finally, to find the sum of their current ages, we add Emil's current age (19) to his father's current age (48) and his brother's current age (12):

\[19 + 48 + 12 = 89\]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of Emil's dad and brother now is 89 years.

- The remaining students after accounting for the football players are \(30 - 6 = 24\).

Out of these 24 students, 25% are either cheerleaders or part of the band. So, \(24 \times 0.25 = 6\) students are either cheerleaders or part of the band.

" On low setting, the air conditioner cools the room by 2 degrees per hour. So in 3 hours, it cools the room by 2 * 3 = 6 degrees.

On high setting, the air conditioner cools the room by 3 degrees per hour. So in 4 hours, it cools the room by 3 * 4 = 12 degrees.

After turning it up to high for 4 hours, the room cooled down by 12 degrees.

Then, it was turned off for 2 hours. Since the room was already cooled down by 12 degrees, there would be no cooling effect from this time period.

Therefore, the net change in temperature after all these operations is the initial temperature minus the final temperature. We can calculate this using the formula:

Final Temperature = Initial Temperature + Net Change in Temperature

The initial temperature is the temperature when the air conditioner was not running (which is 2 degrees higher than the final temperature), so we have:

Initial Temperature = Final Temperature + 2

We don't know the exact value of the final temperature yet, but we can use the information given to set up an equation. Let's assume the final temperature is T degrees. Then we have:

T = Initial Temperature + 2

Substituting the values we know into this equation gives us:

T = (T - 2) + 2

Simplifying this equation gives us:

T = T

This implies that the final temperature is equal to the initial temperature. However, we know that the room warms up at 2 degrees an hour without any air conditioner, so the final temperature must be 2 degrees lower than the initial temperature.

Therefore, the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the initial temperature. 

To find the actual final temperature, we simply subtract 2 from the initial temperature:

Final Temperature = Initial Temperature - 2

Since we don't know the initial temperature, we cannot determine the exact final temperature. However, we know that the final temperature is 2 degrees lower than the initial temperature.

" When Bill's dad was 30 years old, the comet had been orbiting the sun for 30 years.
The comet orbits the sun once every 75 years, so it took 75 - 30 = 45 years for the comet to return to the same spot in the sky.
When Bill saw the comet again, he was three times the age his dad was when he saw it the first time.
If his dad was 30 years old when he saw the comet the first time, then Bill was 3 * 30 = 90 years old when he saw it the second time.
To find out how old Bill was when he saw the comet the first time, we subtract the number of years from the current time.
It has been 75 years since the last time Bill saw the comet, so he must be 75 - (90 - 75) = 75 - 15 = 60 years old.
Therefore, Bill was 60 years old when he saw the comet the first time.

Igneous howls for as long as the other two wolves combined, so Igneous howls for 60 seconds.

Therefore, the combined length of time for all three wolves' howls is \(60 + 60 = 120\) seconds.

" The total age of the four children is 20, so the sum of their ages is 20.

Let's say the age of Helene is H. According to the problem, Helene is twice as old as the average age of the group. So we can write this as:

H = 2 * (A + B + C + D)

where A, B, C, and D represent the ages of Akbar, Alessandro, Helene, and Wilfred respectively.

We know that Akbar is 3 years old and Alessandro is 4 years old. Let's substitute these values into the equation:

H = 2 * (3 + 4 + C + D)
H = 2 * (7 + C + D)

The total age of the children is 20, so we can also write this as:

A + B + H + D = 20

Substituting the value of H from above, we get:

3 + 4 + H + D = 20
H + D = 11

Now we have two equations:

1) H = 2 * (7 + C + D)
2) H + D = 11

We can solve these equations simultaneously to find the values of H, D, and C.

From equation 1), we can express H in terms of C and D:

H = 14 + CD

Substitute this expression for H into equation 2):

(14 + CD) + D = 11
CD + D = -3

Now we have a system of linear equations:

1) H = 14 + CD
2) CD + D = -3

We can solve this system using substitution or elimination method. Here I will use substitution method:

From equation 1), we can express H in terms of D:

H = 14 - CD

Substitute this expression for H into equation 2):

(14 - CD)D = -3
14D - CD^2 = -3

Now we have another equation:

3) 14D - CD^2 = -3

We already know that H + D = 11, so let's substitute H with 14 - CD in this equation:

(14 - CD) + D = 11
14 - CD + D = 11
14 + D = 11 + CD
D = 3 + CD

Now we have two expressions for D:

1) D = 3 + CD
2) D = 3 + 14 - CD
3) D = 17 - CD

Setting these equal to each other gives us:

3 + CD = 17 - CD
2CD = 14
CD = 7

Now we can find the value of D:

D = 3 + 7 = 10

Finally, we can find the value of H:

H = 14 - CD = 14 - 7 = 7

So, the age of Wilfred is 7 years old.

Each person in the church next door received 15 cookies. To find out how many people were in the church next door, we divide the total number of cookies given to the church by the number of cookies per person:

If Jordan plans to make the cake all on the same day and starts at 5:00 pm, we need to subtract this total time from 5:00 pm.

To find out the latest time Jordan can start, we subtract the total time from 5:00 pm:

Solving for \(x\):

"To find out how long James spends reading, we first calculate the time it takes him to read one page:

\[ \text{Time per page} = \frac{\text{Total time}}{\text{Number of pages}} = \frac{10\text{ min}}{3\text{ pages}} = \frac{10}{3}\text{ min/page} \]

Now, if he reads 18 pages, the total time spent reading would be:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Time per page} \times \text{Number of pages} = \left(\frac{10}{3}\right) \times 18\text{ min} \]

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{10}{3} \times 18\text{ min} = 60\text{ min} \]

Therefore, James spends 60 minutes reading.

**Answer:** 60 minutes."
" The hotel originally had 100 guests.
24 guests elected to check out early, so we subtract 24 from the original number of guests: 100 - 24 = 76 guests.
15 guests elected to check out later, so we subtract 15 from the remaining number of guests: 76 - 15 = 61 guests.
In the afternoon, twice as many people checked in as those who opted for a late checkout, so that's 2 * 15 = 30 guests.
Adding these new guests to the remaining number of guests gives us 61 + 30 = 91 guests.
After dinner was served, 7 more people checked in, so we add 7 to the current number of guests: 91 + 7 = 98 guests.
The hotel now has 98 guests.

"To find out how many items Aries will get right, we first calculate the number of easy questions:

\[ \text{Easy questions} = 60 \times 40\% = 60 \times 0.4 = 24 \]

Given that Aries gets 75% of these easy questions correct, she will get \(24 \times 75\% = 24 \times 0.75 = 18\) easy questions correct.

Next, let's determine the number of average and difficult questions. Since there are 60 items in total and 40% are easy, this leaves \(60 - 24 = 36\) items that are either average or difficult.

The problem states that half of the average and difficult questions are correct. So, the number of average and difficult questions Aries gets correct is:

\[ \frac{36}{2} = 18 \]

Adding the number of easy questions (which are all correct) and the number of average/difficult questions (both correct), Aries will get \(18 + 18 = 36\) questions correct in total.

Therefore, Aries is sure to get 36 points from the quiz based on the information provided.

" Let's say the number of small stuffed animals Teresa sold is $x$. Since she sold twice as many large stuffed animals as small ones, the number of large stuffed animals she sold is $2x$.

Each small stuffed animal costs $4$, so the total amount she earned from selling small stuffed animals is $4x$ dollars.

She sold twice as many large stuffed animals as small ones, so the total amount she earned from selling large stuffed animals is $2 \times 4 \times 2x = 16x$ dollars.

We know that she earned $120 from the sales, so we can set up the equation $4x + 16x = 120$.

Combining like terms gives $20x = 120$.

To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by $20$: $x = \frac{120}{20} = 6$.

So, Teresa sold 6 small stuffed animals.
The answer is $\boxed{6}$."

"To find the cost of the package with 8 sandwiches knowing it is proportional to the other packages, we can set up a proportion based on the given information.

Let \(x\) represent the unknown price of the package with 8 sandwiches. We know that:

\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6} = \frac{8}{x} \]

From the first two ratios, we have:

\[ \frac{2}{3} = \frac{4}{6} \]
\[ \Rightarrow 2 \times 6 = 4 \times 3 \]
\[ \Rightarrow 12 = 12 \]

This confirms our initial setup is correct. Now, let's solve for \(x\):

\[ \frac{8}{x} = \frac{4}{6} \]
\[ \Rightarrow 8 \times 6 = 4 \times x \]
\[ \Rightarrow 48 = 4x \]
\[ \Rightarrow x = \frac{48}{4} \]

"If they ordered 20 pizzas and ate 70% of them, then they ate \(20 \times 0.7 = 14\) pizzas.

The number of pizzas eaten by the football team is twice the amount eaten by the glee club, so it's \(14 \times 2 = 28\) pizzas.

Together, they have eaten \(14 + 28 = 42\) pizzas.

They started with 20 pizzas, so after eating 42 pizzas, there are \(20 - 42 = -22\) pizzas left. This doesn't make sense because you can't have negative pizzas. It seems like there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the question. Let's re-evaluate:

If they ate 70% of the pizzas, that means they ate \(20 \times 0.7 = 14\) pizzas. 

Then, if the football team ate 80% of their pizzas, they ate \(20 \times 0.8 = 16\) pizzas.

Adding these together gives us \(14 + 16 = 30\) pizzas eaten in total.

" Dennis needs to make 6 dozen croissants, and since there are 12 croissants in a dozen, he needs to make 6 x 12 = 72 croissants.
He uses 1 pound of butter for every dozen croissants, so he will need 72 pounds of butter.
The grocery store has a promotion where if you buy one pound of butter, you get half off the second pound. So for every 2 pounds of butter, he gets the second pound at half price.
Since he needs 72 pounds of butter, he will need to buy 72/2 = 36 pounds of butter in total.
For the first 2 pounds of butter, he pays full price, so they will cost him 2 x $4.00 = $8.00.
For the next 34 pounds of butter (since he needs 36 pounds total), he gets half off the second pound. So for each of these pounds, he pays half price, or $4.00/2 = $2.00.
The total cost for the next 34 pounds of butter is 34 x $2.00 = $68.00.
Adding up the cost of the first 2 pounds and the next 34 pounds, the total cost is $8.00 + $68.00 = $76.00.

The fee to rent the theater is $125 for a party of 20, so for 41 guests, it would cost 41/20 * $125 = $325.
For each additional guest, the fee is $6. Since there are 41 guests in total, there are 41 - 20 = 21 additional guests.
The additional guests would cost 21 * $6 = $126.

The cost of a dozen roses is $15, so the number of dozens of roses Jenny bought is 15 / 12 = 1.25 dozens.
Since a dozen is equal to 12, Jenny bought approximately 1.25 * 12 = 15 roses.
The total cost of the roses is $30, so the cost of the roses per rose is $30 / 15 = $2.
Jenny paid with five $5 bills, so she paid a total of 5 * $5 = $25.

"To find out how many jellyfish would be created by 5 springs working at the same rate in 4 hours, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours**: Since there are 2 jellyfish created every second, and they form a cycle every 2 seconds (since 1 jellyfish forms after 2 seconds), we divide the time period into intervals where jellyfish formation occurs.

   - The first interval is from 0 to 2 seconds, creating 1 jellyfish.
   - The next interval is from 2 to 4 seconds, creating another 1 jellyfish.
   - This pattern repeats every 2 seconds.

   So, in 4 hours (or 240 seconds), there will be \(240 \div 2 = 120\) intervals of 2 seconds each.

   Therefore, the total number of jellyfish created by one spring in 4 hours is \(120\).

2. **Multiply this number by the number of springs**: There are 5 springs working together.

   Thus, the total number of jellyfish created by all 5 springs in 4 hours is \(5 \times 120 = 600\).

Therefore, 5 springs working at the same rate would create 600 jellyfish in 4 hours.

"Let's denote the amount of fence Sam gets as \(S\) and the amount of fence Harry gets as \(H\). According to the problem:

1. The total length of the fence is 100 feet, so we can write this as an equation: \(S + H = 100\).

2. Harry gets 60 feet more than Sam, so we can express this relationship as another equation: \(H = S + 60\).

Now, let's solve these equations simultaneously.

From the second equation, we can substitute \(H\) in terms of \(S\) into the first equation:

\(S + (S + 60) = 100\)

Combine like terms:

\(2S + 60 = 100\)

Subtract 60 from both sides:

\(2S = 40\)

Divide by 2:

\(S = 20\)

So, Sam gets 20 feet of fence. Now, to find out how much is left over for Sam after splitting the 100 feet evenly, we subtract the amount Sam got from the total:

"Let's denote the original amount of meat (in kilograms) that the small triceratops had as \(T\). According to the problem:

1. The Tyrannosaurus Rex ate half of this \(T\), so it ate \(\frac{T}{2}\).
2. After the T-Rex ate its share, there was \(T - \frac{T}{2} = \frac{1}{2}T\) left.
3. Then, a pack of velociraptors (which we'll call V) scavenged half of what was left, leaving \(\frac{1}{2}T - \frac{V}{2}\).

We know that after all these events, there were 270 kilograms of meat left. So, we can set up the equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}T - \frac{V}{2} = 270
\]

Given that the Allosaurus ate 270 kilograms, we substitute \(V = 270\) into our equation:

\[
\frac{1}{2}T - \frac{270}{2} = 270
\]

Simplifying gives us:

\[
\frac{1}{2}T - 135 = 270
\]

Adding 135 to both sides gives:

\[
\frac{1}{2}T = 405

Multiplying both sides by 2 gives:

Therefore, the small triceratops originally had 810 kilograms of meat.

"If there were 6 jellyfish that changed color when the UV light was turned on, and these represent a third of the large jellyfish, we can find the number of large jellyfish first.

Let's denote the total number of jellyfish as \(J\). According to the problem, a third of the large jellyfish change color when the UV light is turned on. This means:

\[ \frac{1}{3} J = 6 \]

Solving for \(J\) gives us:

\[ J = 6 \times 3 = 18 \]

Therefore, there are 18 jellyfish in the tank initially. Since a fifth of them are large, the number of large jellyfish is:

\[ \frac{1}{5} \times 18 = 3.6 \]

However, the number of jellyfish must be a whole number, so we round this down to 3 large jellyfish. 

Given that a third of the large jellyfish change color, and there are 6 jellyfish that changed color, we can deduce that the total number of jellyfish (\(J\)) is also equal to the sum of the large jellyfish and the small ones (since the small ones remain blue):

\[ J = 3 + S \]
where \(S\) represents the number of small jellyfish.

We know \(J = 18\), so:

\[ 18 = 3 + S \]
\[ S = 18 - 3 = 15 \]

Thus, there are 15 small jellyfish in the tank. Adding the large and small jellyfish together gives us the total number of jellyfish in the tank:

In this case, \(P = \$20,000\), \(r = 0.40\) (since she lives off 40% of her salary), and \(n = 20\).

Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ FV = \$20,000 \times \left(1 + 0.40\right)^{20} \approx \$20,000 \times 1.4^{20} \approx \$20,000 \times 1.966 \approx \$39,320 \]

This means Lauren will have approximately $39,320 at the end of 20 years. To find out how many years it takes to save up to this amount, we divide the future value by the amount saved each year:

\[ \text{Years} = \frac{\text{Future Value}}{\text{Annual Savings}} = \frac{\$39,320}{\$20,000} = 1.966 \]

Since we can't have a fraction of a year, we round up to the nearest whole number because Lauren would need to work longer than one year to accumulate enough savings. Therefore, Lauren needs to work for 2 years to save up for her retirement.

The question asks for how many more years Lauren needs to work, so we subtract the years she already worked from the total years needed:

\[ \text{Additional Years} = 20 - 10 = 10 \]

Therefore, Lauren needs to work for another 10 years to meet her retirement goals.

"To find out how long each final cut will be, we first need to determine the length of one part after it has been divided into 5 equal parts.

Given that Marty has 100 centimeters of ribbon and this ribbon is to be cut into 4 equal parts:

\[ \text{Length of one part} = \frac{\text{Total length of ribbon}}{\text{Number of parts}} = \frac{100\, \text{cm}}{4} = 25\, \text{cm} \]

Now, each of these 25 cm parts is further divided into 5 equal parts:

\[ \text{Length of one final cut} = \frac{\text{Length of one part}}{\text{Number of final cuts}} = \frac{25\, \text{cm}}{5} = 5\, \text{cm} \]

Therefore, each final cut will be 5 centimeters long.

"To find the number of girls in the school, we first need to determine the total student population based on the information given.

Given that 40% of the school population consists of 240 boys, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Percentage of students} = \frac{\text{Number of boys}}{\text{Total students}} \]

Substituting the known values gives us:

\[ 0.40 = \frac{240}{\text{Total students}} \]

Solving for the total students gives us:

\[ \text{Total students} = \frac{240}{0.40} = 600 \]

Now, knowing the total student population is 600, we can calculate the number of girls by subtracting the number of boys from this total:

\[ \text{Number of girls} = \text{Total students} - \text{Number of boys} \]
\[ \text{Number of girls} = 600 - 240 = 360 \]

Therefore, there are 360 girls in the school.

"To calculate how many more miles Soledad needs to hike each day to reach her goal of hiking 9,300 miles within the month of June, we first need to determine how many days are in June.

June has 30 days.

If Soledad hikes 125 miles twice a day, she covers \(125 \times 2 = 250\) miles each day.

To find out how many more miles she needs to cover each day, we subtract the number of miles she already plans to hike from her total goal:

\(9,300 - 250 = 9,050\) miles.

Now, to find out how many more miles per day she needs to hike, divide the remaining distance by the number of days in June:

\(9,050 \div 30 = 301.66...\) miles per day.

Therefore, Soledad must hike approximately 302 miles each day to meet her goal of completing her journey within the month of June.

"To find the number of students enrolled this year, we first calculate the increase in enrollment from last year.

The increase in enrollment is 20% of the original number of students (50). To find this percentage, we multiply the original number of students by the percentage:

\[ \text{Increase} = 50 \times 20\% = 50 \times 0.20 = 10 \]

So, there was a 10 student increase in enrollment this year.

Now, to find the total number of students this year, we add the increase to the original number of students:

\[ \text{Total Enrollment} = 50 + 10 = 60 \]

Therefore, there are 60 students enrolled in the calligraphy class this year.

"To find out how long it takes the light to blink 459 times, we first determine the rate at which the light blinks.

Given that the light blinks 255 times in 5 minutes, we can calculate the number of blinks per minute (BPM) as follows:

\[ \text{BPM} = \frac{\text{Total Blinks}}{\text{Time in Minutes}} = \frac{255}{5} = 51 \]

Now, if the light blinks at a rate of 51 times per minute, we can find out how long it would take to blink 459 times by dividing the total number of blinks by the number of blinks per minute:

\[ \text{Time in Minutes} = \frac{\text{Total Blinks}}{\text{BPM}} = \frac{459}{51} = 9 \]

Therefore, it would take the light 9 minutes to blink 459 times.

"To calculate the total time it took for Amalia, Megan, and Dior to complete their chores, we first need to determine the time each person spent on their respective tasks.

**Amalia's Work:**
- Mowing the lawn took her 4 hours.

**Megan's Work:**
- Walking the dog took her \(4\) hours plus \(2\) hours longer than mowing the lawn, which equals \(4 + 2 = 6\) hours.

**Dior's Work:**
- Doing laundry took her \(4\) hours plus \(4\) hours longer than mowing the lawn, which equals \(4 + 4 = 8\) hours.

Now, let's add up the times for all three:

- Total time for Amalia = \(4\) hours
- Total time for Megan = \(6\) hours
- Total time for Dior = \(8\) hours

Adding these together gives us the total time taken for all three chores:

" Let's say Seth had \(x\) stickers in the beginning.

Seth gave half of his stickers to Luis, so Luis received \(\frac{x}{2}\) stickers.

After using some stickers, Luis had \(\frac{x}{4}\) stickers left.

Then, Luis gave the remaining stickers (which is \(\frac{x}{4}\)) to Kris. So, Kris received \(\frac{x}{4}\) stickers.

Kris kept 9 of the stickers, so we can set up the equation:

\[\frac{x}{4} = 9.\]

To solve for \(x\), we multiply both sides of the equation by 4:

"To find out how many days it takes for Alfie to fly half of the way around the Earth, we first calculate the total distance around the Earth.

The circumference of the Earth is given as 40,000 kilometers. Half of this distance would be \( \frac{1}{2} \times 40,000 = 20,000 \) kilometers.

Now, if Alfie flies 400 kilometers every day, we can divide the total distance by his daily flight distance to find out how many days it will take him:

\[ \text{Days} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Daily Flight Distance}} = \frac{20,000}{400} = 50 \]

"Let's denote the number of eggs Arnold, Madeline, and Camden painted as A, M, and C respectively.

From the information given:

1) Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, so \(A = M\).

2) Camden and Sarah painted a total of 30 eggs, and Camden painted 12 more than Sarah. This gives us two equations:

- \(C + S = 30\) (total eggs)
- \(C = S + 12\) (Camden painted 12 more than Sarah)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to find the value of S:

\(S + 12 + S = 30\)

Combine like terms:

\(2S + 12 = 30\)

Subtract 12 from both sides:

\(2S = 18\)

Divide by 2:

\(S = 9\)

Now we know that Camden painted 9 eggs and Sarah painted 9 + 12 = 21 eggs.

To find out how many eggs Arnold painted, we use the fact that they all painted the same number of eggs:

\(A = M = \frac{Total}{3} = \frac{56}{3}\)

Calculating this gives us approximately 18.67 eggs per person. Since we're dealing with whole numbers of eggs, we'll round down to the nearest whole number, meaning Arnold painted 18 eggs.

The difference between what Arnold and Madeline painted is:

\(M - A = 18 - 18 = 0\)

Therefore, Arnold and Madeline painted the same number of eggs, which means there were no more eggs painted by either of them than the other. The question asks for how many more eggs Camden painted than Arnold, but since there were no more eggs painted by either of them, the answer is 0.

"Grandma walks 3 miles every day on her favorite walking trail, which includes 2 miles of walking on the beach and 1 mile of walking on the sidewalk.

On the beach, she spends 40 minutes walking. Since the distance on the beach is 2 miles, we can find the time it takes to walk one mile on the beach by dividing the time by the number of miles walked there. So, \( \frac{40}{2} = 20\) minutes per mile on the beach.

On the sidewalk, she walks at twice the rate of speed that she does on the beach. This means she walks at \(20 \times 2 = 40\) minutes per mile on the sidewalk.

The total distance she walks in a day is 3 miles, so the time spent on the beach (which is 2 miles) plus the time spent on the sidewalk (which is 1 mile) equals the total time spent walking:

For the second period (30 days), Chester eats 5 eggs a day. The total number of eggs consumed during this period is \(5 \times 30 = 150\) eggs.

Adding these together gives us the total number of eggs consumed over the 60-day period:

- He earns $56 from selling bouquets per day, so he also makes \(56 \div 12 = \$4.67\) from selling individual sunflowers.

Therefore, his total daily earnings from selling sunflowers is \(24 + 4.67 = \$28.67\).

Now, let's calculate how many sunflowers he can sell with this amount over 3 days:

"To find out how many bottles of juice Hortex would have to produce to meet 100% of the daily energy needs of 2300 people, we first calculate the total daily energy requirement for all 2300 people.

Given that each bottle covers 20% of one person's daily energy demand, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total Energy Requirement} = 2300 \times 20\% = 2300 \times 0.2 = 460 \text{ bottles} \]

Now, if Hortex were to produce enough bottles to meet this total energy requirement, they would need to produce:

\[ \frac{\text{Total Energy Requirement}}{\text{Energy Coverage per Bottle}} = \frac{460}{0.2} = 2300 \text{ bottles} \]

Hortex currently produces 4200 bottles per day. To find out how many more bottles they need to produce to reach their goal, we subtract the current production from the required production:

\[ 2300 - 4200 = -1900 \]

However, since the result is negative, it indicates that Hortex already meets or exceeds its daily energy requirements with the current production level. Therefore, there is no need for them to produce any additional bottles to meet the energy demands of 2300 people. The question seems to contain a misunderstanding because producing more bottles than needed would not increase the number of bottles available to meet the energy needs of 2300 people."

"To find out how many reports the IRS received on Wednesday, we first need to calculate the total number of reports received from Monday through Friday.

From Monday to Friday (Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Friday), the total number of reports received is:

\[1907 \text{ (Monday and Tuesday)} + 2136 \text{ (Thursday and Friday)}\]

\[= 1907 + 2136 = 4043 \text{ reports}\]

Given that the IRS received 5168 tax reports last week, we can subtract the total reported from Monday through Friday from this figure to find out how many were received on Wednesday:

\[5168 \text{ (total)} - 4043 \text{ (from Monday to Friday)}\]

\[= 1125 \text{ reports}\]

Therefore, the IRS received 1125 reports on Wednesday.

" Abraham initially had 80 square meters of land. He sold half of it, so he sold 80/2 = 40 square meters for $50.
He then sold another quarter of his land, which is 80/4 = 20 square meters, for $30.
The total amount of money he earned from these two sales is 40*$50 + 20*$30 = $2000 + $600 = $2600.
The remaining land is 80 - (40 + 20) = 20 square meters.
He sells this remaining land at $3 per square meter, so he will earn 20*$3 = $60 from this sale.
To find out how much money he will be able to earn in total, we add the earnings from the first two sales and the last sale: $2600 + $60 = $2660.

A 6-year-old avocado tree produces \(50 \times 3 = 150\) fruits.

A 7-year-old avocado tree produces \(150 \times 7 = 1050\) fruits.

An 8-year-old avocado tree produces \(1050 - 200 = 850\) fruits.

During the ninth year, the avocado tree doesn't produce any fruit, so it still produces 850 fruits.

A 10-year-old avocado tree produces \(850 \times 20 = 17000\) fruits.

"Let's denote the length of the blue rope as \(B\), the length of the yellow rope as \(Y\), and the length of the red rope as \(R\).

From the information given:

1. The red rope is four times the length of the blue rope: \(R = 4B\).
2. The blue rope is 7 centimeters shorter than the yellow rope: \(B = Y - 7\).
3. The sum of all three ropes' lengths is 37 centimeters: \(R + B + Y = 37\).

Substituting the first two equations into the third gives us:

\(4B + (Y - 7) + Y = 37\)

Simplifying this equation:

\(4B + 2Y - 7 = 37\)

Adding 7 to both sides:

\(4B + 2Y = 44\)

Dividing through by 2:

\(2B + Y = 22\)

Now we have two equations:

1. \(R = 4B\)
2. \(2B + Y = 22\)

We can solve these simultaneously. From equation 1, we get \(R = 4B\). Substituting this into equation 2 gives:

\(2(4B) + Y = 22\)

Solving for \(Y\) gives:

\(8B + Y = 22\)

Subtracting 8B from both sides:

\(Y = 22 - 8B\)

But we also know \(Y = 2B + 7\), so substituting this into our equation for \(Y\) gives:

\(2B + 7 = 22 - 8B\)

Bringing like terms to one side:

\(9B = 15\)

Therefore,

\(B = \frac{15}{9} = \frac{5}{3}\) centimeters.

Knowing \(B = \frac{5}{3}\) and using \(R = 4B\), we find:

\(R = 4 \times \frac{5}{3} = \frac{20}{3}\) centimeters.

Thus, the length of the red rope is \(\frac{20}{3}\) or approximately 6.67 centimeters.

"Let's denote the amount of each color of paint as follows:

- Red: \(R\)
- White: \(W\)
- Purple: \(P\)
- Yellow: \(Y\)

Given that there are equal amounts of red, white, and purple paint, we can express this relationship as:

\[R = W = P\]

We also know that half of the mural is yellow, so:

\[Y = \frac{1}{2} \times M\]
where \(M\) is the total number of pints of paint.

The total number of pints of paint used in the mural is given as 12, so:

\[M = R + W + P + Y\]
\[12 = R + W + P + \frac{1}{2} \times 12\]
\[12 = R + W + P + 6\]
\[12 = 2(R + W + P)\]
\[6 = R + W + P\]

Since \(R = W = P\), we can substitute these values into the equation:

\[6 = 3R\]
\[R = 2\]

Therefore, 2 pints of red paint were used in the mural.

"The teacher used up 45% of the chalk, meaning he had 55% left after Monday. This means he started with 55% of the original amount of chalk.

Let's denote the original amount of chalk as \(x\). So, we can set up the equation:

\[0.55x = \text{original amount of chalk}\]

To find the original amount of chalk (\(x\)), we solve for \(x\) from the equation above:

\[x = \frac{\text{original amount of chalk}}{0.55} = \frac{x}{0.55}\]

Now, let's calculate the number of days until recycling. We know that the teacher uses 20% of the chalk each day. Let's denote the number of days until recycling as \(d\).

On Monday, the teacher used up 45% of the chalk, which means he had 55% left. This means he used up 55% of the original amount of chalk over \(d\) days. Therefore, we can set up another equation:

\[0.55x = 0.20x^2\]

Solving this quadratic equation will give us the value of \(x\), which represents the original amount of chalk. However, since we're looking for the number of days until recycling, we'll first solve for \(x\) and then determine how many days it takes to reach 20%.

In 25 years, Colin will be a third as old as Wendy is now. So in 25 years, Colin's age will be $\frac{5x + 35}{3}$.
We know that in 25 years, Colin's age will be $x+25$, so we can set up the equation $\frac{5x + 35}{3} = x + 25$.
Multiplying both sides by 3 gives us $5x + 35 = 3x + 75$.
Subtracting $3x$ from both sides gives us $2x + 35 = 75$.

" Let's represent the number of coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge as \(x\).
Four times the number of coffee mugs is \(4x\).
Adding eight to this gives us \(4x + 8\).
We know that this is equal to 40, so we can set up the equation \(4x + 8 = 40\).
To solve for \(x\), we first subtract 8 from both sides of the equation: \(4x = 40 - 8 = 32\).
Then, we divide both sides of the equation by 4: \(x = \frac{32}{4} = 8\).
So, there are 8 coffee mugs in the teacher's lounge.
The answer is $\boxed{8}$."
"To find out how many fish have red stripes and blue stripes, we first calculate the number of fish with red stripes.

One-third of the fish have red stripes, so:

\[ \text{Red striped fish} = \frac{1}{3} \times 66 = 22 \]

The remaining fish after accounting for those with red stripes would be:

\[ \text{Remaining fish} = 66 - 22 = 44 \]

Then, we find out how many of these remaining fish have blue stripes:

\[\frac{5}{11} \times 44 = 20 \]

Therefore, there are \(22\) fish with red stripes and \(20\) fish with blue stripes in total.

" Mattison's height is given as 60 inches.

The two-story house is 7 times as high as he is, so the height of the house is \(7 \times 60 = 420\) inches.

The floor to the ceiling on the first floor is three times his height, so it is \(3 \times 60 = 180\) inches.

To find the height of the roof from the second floor's floor, we subtract the height of the first floor from the height of the house. So, the height of the roof is \(420 - 180 = 240\) inches.

Therefore, the roof is 240 inches high.

"To calculate Deandre's earnings from selling all the tunas, we first need to find the total weight of the tunas he caught.

The total weight of the tunas is calculated by adding the weights of each tuna:

Total weight = First tuna weight + Second tuna weight + Last tuna weight
Total weight = 56 kg + 46 kg + 26 kg
Total weight = 128 kg

Next, we'll determine the total amount he can earn from selling these tunas at $0.50 per kilogram. To do this, we multiply the total weight by the price per kilogram:

Earnings = Total weight Ã— Price per kilogram
Earnings = 128 kg Ã— $0.50/kg
Earnings = $64

Therefore, Deandre will earn $64 after selling all the tunas to the market.

"To find Trinity's profit, we first calculate the selling price of the magazines and then subtract the cost from it.

Given:
- The original price of the magazines is $72.
- She sells them at \( \frac{11}{8} \) of the original price.

First, let's find the selling price (\(SP\)):

\[ SP = \frac{11}{8} \times \text{Original Price} \]

Substitute the given value:

\[ SP = \frac{11}{8} \times \$72 \]
\[ SP = \$99 \]

Now, to find her profit, we subtract the cost from the selling price:

\[ Profit = SP - \text{Cost} \]

Substitute the values:

\[ Profit = \$99 - \$72 \]
\[ Profit = \$27 \]

Therefore, Trinity's profit is $27.

"The low setting removes 1 liter of water per day.

On the low setting, over 3 days, it would remove \(1 \times 3 = 3\) liters of water.

The medium setting removes twice as much water per day as the low setting, so it removes \(2 \times 1 = 2\) liters per day.

Over 3 days on the medium setting, it would remove \(2 \times 3 = 6\) liters of water.

The high setting removes twice as much water per day as the medium setting, so it removes \(2 \times 2 = 4\) liters per day.

Over 3 days on the high setting, it would remove \(4 \times 3 = 12\) liters of water.

Adding up all the water removed:

Low setting: 3 liters
Medium setting: 6 liters

"To find out how far Michael has traveled after three days, we first calculate his total travel time.

Given that he travels at an average speed of 50 km/hour, we can use the formula:

First, convert his average speed from kilometers per hour to kilometers per day:

\[ 50 \, \text{km/hour} = 50 \, \text{km/day} \]

Now, let's calculate the total distance he covers over three days:

\[ \text{Total Distance} = 50 \, \text{km/day} \times 3 \, \text{days} = 150 \, \text{km} \]

The question asks for the percentage of the 6000 km distance that Michael has covered. To do this, we divide the distance he has already traveled by the total distance and multiply by 100 to get the percentage:

\[ \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{\text{Distance Already Traveled}}{\text{Total Distance}} \right) \times 100 \]

Substituting the values we have:

\[ \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{150}{6000} \right) \times 100 \]

\[ \text{Percentage Covered} = \left( \frac{1}{40} \right) \times 100 \]

"If there were 20 helmets, and half as many robots as helmets, then there were \(20 \times 2 = 40\) robots.

Similarly, if there were 20 helmets and half as many as that, then there were \(20 \times 2 = 40\) footballs.

To find the total number of items Dominick saw, we add the number of helmets, robots, and footballs together:

\(20 (\text{helmets}) + 40 (\text{robots}) + 40 (\text{footballs}) = 100\)

Therefore, Dominick saw a total of 100 items.

"If it usually takes 7 minutes for the coat of varnish to dry on one painting, then with 6 paintings, it would normally take \(7 \times 6 = 42\) minutes.

However, with the new varnish that takes 12 minutes to dry, it would take \(12 \times 6 = 72\) minutes for the coats of varnish on all 6 paintings.

To find out how much longer it would take with the new varnish compared to the old one, we subtract the time it takes with the old varnish from the time it takes with the new varnish:

\(72 - 42 = 30\) minutes.

Therefore, it would take 30 minutes longer for the coat of varnish on 6 paintings with the new varnish than it would with the old one.

" For the 4 plants that need half a cup of water, they will need 4 * .5 = 2 cups of water.
For the 8 plants that need 1 cup of water, they will need 8 * 1 = 8 cups of water.
The total amount of water needed for these two groups of plants is 2 + 8 = 10 cups of water.
The remaining number of plants is 20 - (4 + 8) = 8 plants.
These 8 plants need a quarter of a cup of water each, so they will need 8 * .25 = 2 cups of water.
Adding up the water needed for all three groups of plants, Crista will need 10 + 2 = 12 cups of water every day for her plants.

"To find out how long it takes Phineas to return home, we first calculate the time spent hopping and swimming.

Half of the distance is on land, so Phineas hops 200 yards on land. At a speed of 20 yards per minute, this would take him:

\[ \frac{200}{20} = 10 \text{ minutes} \]

Half of the distance is also in water, so Phineas swims 200 yards in water. At a speed of 10 yards per minute, this would take him:

\[ \frac{200}{10} = 20 \text{ minutes} \]

Adding these times together gives us the total time Phineas spends returning home:

\[ 10 + 20 = 30 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take Phineas 30 minutes to return home.

"To calculate the total amount of money Derrick makes in June, we first need to determine how many doughnuts he bakes daily and then multiply that number by the price per doughnut.

Given:
- Derrick bakes 10 dozen doughnuts every day (which equals \(10 \times 12 = 120\) doughnuts).
- Each doughnut is sold for $2.

Now, let's calculate the total earnings for one day:

\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Number of Doughnuts} \times \text{Price Per Doughnut} \]
\[ \text{Daily Earnings} = 120 \times \$2 = \$240 \]

Finally, to find the total earnings for the month of June (assuming 30 days), we multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in June:

\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days in June} \]
\[ \text{Total Earnings} = \$240 \times 30 = \$7200 \]

Therefore, Derrick makes $7200 in June from selling all his doughnuts."

In the final 30 seconds, there were half the rate of the previous 30 seconds, so \(80 \div 2 = 40\) pops.

The total number of pops before eating any is \(20 + 60 + 80 + 40 = 200\).

Then he turned around and traveled east for 8 hours at the same average speed of 18 mph, so he covered another distance of 8 * 18 = 144 miles.
The total distance he traveled is the sum of the distances he traveled west and east, so it is 90 + 144 = 234 miles.
To find out how far he is from his house, we can subtract the distance he traveled from the total distance he traveled, so it is 234 - 90 = 144 miles.

In the second year, the boat depreciates again by 30% of the remaining value of $6300, so the depreciation is $6300 * 0.30 = $1890.
After the second year, the value of the boat is $6300 - $1890 = $4410.

In the third year, the boat depreciates by 20% of the remaining value of $4410, so the depreciation is $4410 * 0.20 = $882.

"To calculate the total amount of money Matthew would earn from selling his collection, we first need to determine how many toys he has in total.

Given that Matthew has 12 unique toy soldiers and he sells half of them at $5 per toy, and the other half at $7 per toy, we can set up the equation:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = (\text{Number of toys at $5}) + (\text{Number of toys at $7}) \]

Let's denote the number of toys at $5 as \(x\) and the number of toys at $7 as \(y\). We know that \(x + y = 12\) (since there are 12 unique toys).

The total earnings can also be expressed as:

\[ \text{Total earnings} = 5x + 7y \]

We now have two equations:

1) \(x + y = 12\)
2) \(5x + 7y = ?\)

From equation 1), we can express \(y\) in terms of \(x\):

Substituting this into equation 2 gives us:

\[ 5x + 84 - 7x = ? \]
\[ 84 - 2x = ? \]

Now, let's solve for \(x\):

Since we don't have the specific value for \(x\), we cannot directly calculate the exact total earnings without knowing how many toys were sold at $5 and how many at $7. However, if you provide the values for \(x\) or \(y\), I can help you calculate the total earnings based on those numbers.

"To find out how many chocolate chip cookies the Adams family has made, we first need to add up all the cookies they've already made:

- Rainbow cookies: 2595
- Oatmeal cookies: 3075

Now, let's add these two amounts together:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = 2595 + 3075 = 5670 \]

They've made a total of 5670 cookies so far. Since they've made 7995 cookies in total, we can subtract this from the total number of cookies made to find out how many chocolate chip cookies there are:

\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = \text{Total cookies} - \text{Cookies made} \]
\[ \text{Chocolate chip cookies} = 7995 - 5670 = 2325 \]

Therefore, the Adams family has made 2325 chocolate chip cookies.

"Let's break down the information given:

- Igor was supposed to gather 16 test tubes.
- Igor was supposed to gather 7 beakers.
- Igor was supposed to gather 14 Petri dishes.

By accident, Igor gathered half as many test tubes as requested, so he gathered \(16 \div 2 = 8\) test tubes.
Igor gathered two more than the number of Petri dishes requested, so he gathered \(14 + 2 = 16\) Petri dishes.

The total number of items Igor gathered before losing any is \(8 + 16 + 14 = 38\).

Given that the total number of items on the lab bench was 29, we can find out how many beakers Igor lost by subtracting the total number of items from the actual total:

\(38 - 29 = 9\)

Therefore, Igor lost 9 beakers.

"If there are 10 eggs in one basket, and twice as many in another basket, then there are \(10 \times 2 = 20\) eggs in the other basket.

"Alexandra raised $430.

Kim raised $320 more than Alexandra, so Kim raised $430 + $320 = $750.

Maryam raised $400 more than Sarah, who raised $300, so Maryam raised $300 + $400 = $700.

Sarah raised $300.

Adding up all their amounts gives us the total amount raised:

$430 (Alexandra) + $750 (Kim) + $700 (Maryam) + $300 (Sarah) = $2280.

Therefore, they raised a total of $2280.

"If Vanessa ran 4 miles and Aaron ran twice as fast as her, then Aaron ran \(4 \times 2 = 8\) miles.

Given that Aaron took 16 minutes to complete his part of the race, we can calculate the time it took Vanessa to complete her part by dividing the distance she ran by her speed:

Vanessa's speed = Distance / Time
Vanessa's speed = 4 miles / 16 minutes

To find the time it took Vanessa to run 4 miles at this speed, we divide 4 miles by her speed:

Time = Distance / Speed
Time = 4 miles / (4 miles / 16 minutes)

Simplifying the equation gives us:

Time = 4 miles * (16 minutes / 4 miles)
Time = 4 * 4
Time = 16 minutes

Therefore, Vanessa took 16 minutes to complete her part of the race.

"They get 6 reservations a night and each reservation orders 2 meals so thatâ€™s 6*2 = 12 meals
Each meal costs $5 and they order 12 so thatâ€™s 12*5 = $60 in meals
They also have a $5 bottle of wine and they order one a night for 6 nights so thatâ€™s 5*5 = $25 in wine
On the other 1.5 nights they donâ€™t have any wine and still charge $60 in meals
So in total they make 60+60+25 = $145 a night
If they are open 2 nights a week then they make 145*2 = $290 a week

"James is currently 2(12) = 24 years old.
When John turned 32, James was born so James is 24-32 = 8 years old.

"In one hour, there are 60 minutes.

Ana spends 3 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{3} = 20 \) oranges.

Jane spends 4 minutes peeling an orange, so in 60 minutes, she can peel \( \frac{60}{4} = 15 \) oranges.

Therefore, Ana will have peeled \( 20 - 15 = 5 \) more oranges than Jane after an hour.

" Let's say the number of chickens is $x$ and the number of cows is $y$. We know that there are 20 animals in total, so we can write the equation $x + y = 20$.

We also know that each chicken has 2 legs and each cow has 4 legs. The total number of legs is given as 70, so we can write the equation $2x + 4y = 70$.

Now we have a system of two equations:

\[
\begin{cases}
x + y = 20 \\
2x + 4y = 70
\end{cases}
\]

We can solve this system of equations step by step.

First, let's multiply the first equation by 2 to make the coefficients of $x$ in both equations the same:

\[
\begin{cases}
2(x + y) = 2 \cdot 20 \\
2x + 4y = 70
\end{cases}
\]

Simplifying the first equation gives us:

\[
2x + 2y = 40
\]

Subtracting this from the second equation gives us:

\[
(2x + 4y) - (2x + 2y) = 70 - 40
\]
\[
2y = 30
\]
\[
y = 15
\]

Now that we know $y$, we can substitute it back into the first equation to find $x$:

\[
x + 15 = 20
\]
\[
x = 5
\]

So, Farmer Brown has 5 chickens on his farm.
The answer is $\boxed{5}$."
