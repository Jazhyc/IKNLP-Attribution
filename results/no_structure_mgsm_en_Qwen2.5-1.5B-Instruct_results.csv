"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid per day by all ducks:** 
   \[
   3 \text{ (eggs per duck)} \times 16 \text{ (ducks)} = 48 \text{ eggs}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of eggs eaten by Janet each day:**
   \[
   3 \text{ (eggs per day)} \times 3 \text{ (morning)} = 9 \text{ eggs}
   \]
   
3. **Calculate the number of eggs used for baking muffins each day:**
   \[
   4 \text{ (muffin batches)} \times 4 \text{ (eggs per batch)} = 16 \text{ eggs}
   \]

4. **Find out how many eggs remain after accounting for eating and baking:**
   \[
   48 \text{ (total eggs)} - 9 \text{ (eaten)} - 16 \text{ (used for muffins)} = 23 \text{ eggs remaining}
   \]

5. **Calculate the revenue generated from selling the remaining eggs at $2 per egg:**
   \[
   23 \text{ (remaining eggs)} \times \$2/\text{egg} = \$46
   \]

Thus, Janet makes \(\boxed{46}\) dollars every day at the farmers' market."
"To determine the total number of bolts of fabric needed for a robe, we need to consider both the blue and white fibers separately:

1. **Blue Fiber**: 
   The problem states that the robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.

2. **White Fiber**:
   It is given that the amount of white fiber required is half the amount of blue fiber. Therefore, the amount of white fiber needed is:
   \[
   \frac{2}{2} = 1 \text{ bolt}
   \]

3. **Total Number of Bolts**:
   To find the total number of bolts of fabric needed, we add the number of blue bolts to the number of white bolts:
   \[
   2 \text{ (blue)} + 1 \text{ (white)} = 3 \text{ bolts}
   \]

Therefore, the total number of bolts of fabric needed is 3."
"To determine Josh's profit from the flip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new value of the house after repairs:**
   The original price of the house was $80,000. Adding the $50,000 in repairs increases the value by $50,000.
   \[
   \text{New Value} = \$80,000 + \$50,000 = \$130,000
   \]

2. **Determine the selling price:**
   The problem states that the increase in value due to repairs resulted in an additional 150% of the original purchase price. To find this amount, multiply the original price by 150% (or 1.5):
   \[
   \text{Increase in Value} = 1.5 \times \$80,000 = \$120,000
   \]
   Therefore, the selling price of the house is the sum of the original purchase price and the increase in value:
   \[
   \text{Selling Price} = \$80,000 + \$120,000 = \$200,000
   \]

3. **Calculate the profit:**
   Profit is calculated as the difference between the selling price and the initial investment (original purchase price plus repairs).
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \text{Selling Price} - (\text{Original Purchase Price} + \text{Repairs})
   \]
   Substituting the values we found:
   \[
   \text{Profit} = \$200,000 - (\$80,000 + \$50,000) = \$200,000 - \$130,000 = \$70,000
   \]

Therefore, Josh made a profit of $\boxed{70000}$ dollars."
"To find out how many total meters James runs a week, you need to multiply the number of sprints by the distance he runs per sprint and then by the frequency of those sprints:

Number of sprints per week = 3 (sprints/week)
Distance per sprint = 60 meters

Total meters per week = Number of sprints per week × Distance per sprint
Total meters per week = 3 × 60
Total meters per week = 180

So, James runs a total of 180 meters a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we first need to determine the total amount of feed given to all the chickens during the day.

We know that Wendi gives each chicken 3 cups of feed per day. Since there are 20 chickens, the total number of cups of feed given throughout the day would be:

\[ \text{Total cups} = 20 \text{ chickens} \times 3 \text{ cups/chicken} = 60 \text{ cups} \]

Next, we add up the amounts of feed given in the morning and afternoon:

\[ \text{Morning feed} = 15 \text{ cups} \]
\[ \text{Afternoon feed} = 25 \text{ cups} \]

So far, Wendi has given a total of:

\[ \text{Total given} = 15 \text{ cups (morning)} + 25 \text{ cups (afternoon)} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Now, to find out how many cups are needed for the final meal, we subtract the total given from the total available:

\[ \text{Final meal feed} = \text{Total cups} - \text{Total given}
\]
\[ \text{Final meal feed} = 60 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups}
\]
\[ \text{Final meal feed} = 20 \text{ cups} \]

Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 20 cups of feed in the final meal of the day."
"To calculate the total cost, we first determine the number of glasses that cost $5 and those that cost 60% of $5.

There are 8 glasses that cost $5 (since 16 / 2 = 8).

There are 8 glasses that cost 60% of $5 or $3 (since 16 - 8 = 8 and 8 * 60% = 8 * 0.6 = 4.8, rounding down to 4 since you can't have a fraction of a glass).

Now, let's add these up:

Cost of 8 glasses at full price: 8 * $5 = $40

Cost of 8 glasses at discounted price: 8 * $3 = $24

Total cost: $40 + $24 = $64

So, Kylar needs to pay $64 for all 16 glasses."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Seattle's Sheep**: Seattle has 20 sheep.
   
2. **Charleston's Sheep**: Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle. Since Seattle has 20 sheep,
   \[
   \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 = 80 \text{ sheep}
   \]

3. **Toulouse's Sheep**: Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston. Since Charleston has 80 sheep,
   \[
   \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 = 160 \text{ sheep}
   \]

Now, we add up all the sheep:

\[
\text{Total sheep} = \text{Toulouse's sheep} + \text{Charleston's sheep} + \text{Seattle's sheep}
\]
\[
\text{Total sheep} = 160 + 80 + 20
\]
\[
\text{Total sheep} = 260
\]

So, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together have 260 sheep."
"To calculate the time it takes to download the entire file, we need to break down the process into parts:

1. Calculate the time taken to download the first half of the file (100 GB):

   Time = File size / Download speed
   
   Time = 100 GB / 2 GB/min
   
   Time = 50 minutes

2. The second half of the file (another 100 GB) will take the same amount of time as the first half since the download speed remains constant during this part of the download:

   Time = 50 minutes

3. Add the time taken by Windows to force a restart and restart the download:

   Restart time = 20 minutes

   Total time = First half time + Second half time + Restart time
   
   Total time = 50 minutes + 50 minutes + 20 minutes
   
   Total time = 120 minutes

Therefore, it would take Carla 120 minutes to download the entire file."
"Let's break down John's journey step by step:

1. **Initial Drive (First 3 Hours):**
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance covered: \( 60 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Arrival at Home (Turning Around):**
   - No distance is traveled here since he returns immediately to home.

3. **Return Journey (Next 2 Hours):**
   - Speed: 0 mph (due to standing traffic)
   - Time: 2 hours
   - Distance covered: \( 0 \text{ mph} \times 2 \text{ hours} = 0 \text{ miles} \)

4. **Traveling Backwards (Next Half Hour):**
   - Speed: 30 mph
   - Time: 0.5 hours
   - Distance covered: \( 30 \text{ mph} \times 0.5 \text{ hours} = 15 \text{ miles} \)

5. **Remaining Distance to Home (Next 4 Hours):**
   - Total travel time including the last part: \( 3 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} + 0.5 \text{ hours} = 5.5 \text{ hours} \)
   - Remaining time to cover: \( 4 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours} = -1.5 \text{ hours} \)
     This indicates an error; we need to correct it as follows:

   - Corrected Remaining Time: Since he already spent 5.5 hours traveling, he needs to spend only 4 hours out of the 4 available. 
   - Therefore, he covers \( 4 \text{ hours} \).

6. **Distance Covered in Remaining 4 Hours:**
   - Speed: 80 mph
   - Time: 4 hours
   - Distance covered: \( 80 \text{ mph} \times 4 \text{ hours} = 320 \text{ miles} \)

Now, let's calculate the final position relative to home:

- Initial distance: 180 miles
- Travelled backwards: 15 miles
- Travelling back towards home: 320 miles

**Final Position Relative to Home"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to consider both her regular work hours and her overtime hours.

First, let's determine her earnings for the first 40 hours:

Regular pay for 40 hours = Hourly rate × Hours worked
Regular pay for 40 hours = $10/hour × 40 hours
Regular pay for 40 hours = $400

Next, let's calculate her earnings for the overtime hours (after 40 hours):

Overtime pay = Overtime rate × Hours worked
Since she received a 1.2 times her regular hourly rate as overtime pay,
Overtime rate = Regular rate × 1.2
Overtime rate = $10/hour × 1.2
Overtime rate = $12/hour

Now, calculate the overtime pay for the additional 5 hours:

Overtime pay = $12/hour × 5 hours
Overtime pay = $60

Finally, add the regular pay and overtime pay together to find her total earnings for the week:

Total earnings = Regular pay + Overtime pay
Total earnings = $400 + $60
Total earnings = $460

So, Eliza earned $460 for the week."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

**First Month:** 
- Downloads: 60

**Second Month:**
- Number of downloads increased three times compared to the first month:
  \[
  3 \times 60 = 180
  \]

- However, these additional downloads were reduced by 30% in the following month.
  \[
  180 \times (1 - 0.30) = 180 \times 0.70 = 126
  \]

So, in the second month, there were 126 downloads.

**Third Month:**
- We know that this month's download count remains consistent with the previous month's increase minus a reduction of 30%.

Since the question states ""reduced by 30%"" rather than adding it back, we'll assume this is an error in interpretation. 

If the intention was to keep the same percentage reduction, we would calculate it as follows:
\[
126 \times (1 - 0.30) = 126 \times 0.70 = 88.2
\]
This seems unusual because you cannot have a fraction of a download; hence, it may indicate an error in data or calculation steps provided in the initial statement.

Given the inconsistency, let's focus on the correct interpretation if needed, otherwise, I'll proceed assuming no fractional downloads.

**Total Downloads Over Three Months:**
\[
60 (\text{first month}) + 126 (\text{second month}) + 88.2 (\text{third month})
\]

Adding these together gives us approximately 274.2 downloads, which isn't practical since you can't have partial downloads.

Therefore, based on the given information and assumptions, the closest reasonable whole number of downloads would be **274**, acknowledging potential rounding errors due to fractional downloads not being practically possible."
"To find out the total cost of Toula's purchases, we need to calculate the cost of each type of pastry separately and then add them together.

For the donuts:
Cost of one dozen donuts = $68
Number of dozens of donuts = 3
Total cost of donuts = Cost of one dozen donuts × Number of dozens
= $68 × 3
= $204

For the mini cupcakes:
Cost of one dozen mini cupcakes = $80
Number of dozens of mini cupcakes = 2
Total cost of mini cupcakes = Cost of one dozen mini cupcakes × Number of dozens
= $80 × 2
= $160

For the mini cheesecakes:
Cost of one dozen mini cheesecakes = $55
Number of dozens of mini cheesecakes = 6
Total cost of mini cheesecakes = Cost of one dozen mini cheesecakes × Number of dozens
= $55 × 6
= $330

Now, let's add up all the costs:

Total cost = Total cost of donuts + Total cost of mini cupcakes + Total cost of mini cheesecakes
= $204 + $160 + $330
= $694

Therefore, the total cost of Toula's purchases was $694."
"To determine how many years Carlos needs to wait until he starts earning money from selling lemons, we need to calculate both his expenses and income over time and find when these match up.

Firstly, let's establish the initial conditions:

- Initial cost to plant the lemon tree: $90
- Annual growth rate of lemons: 7 per year
- Selling price of each lemon: $1.5
- Annual watering and feeding cost: $3

We want to know how many years \( n \) it takes for Carlos to earn back his initial investment ($90).

Each year, Carlos earns \( 7 \times \$1.5 \) from selling lemons and spends \( \$3 \) on maintenance. Therefore, his net gain per year is:
\[ (\$1.5 \times 7) - \$3 \]

Let's calculate this:
\[ (\$10.5) - \$3 = \$7.5 \]

So, Carlos gains $7.5 annually. 

Now, we need to determine how many years it takes to reach or exceed $90:
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{\text{Total Cost}}{\text{Annual Net Gain}} \]
\[ \text{Years} = \frac{90}{7.5} \]
\[ \text{Years} = 12 \]

Thus, it will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree by subtracting his initial cost of $90 from his annual net profit of $7.5 per year."
"To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, let's work backwards through the given information:

1. Let's denote the initial number of vacuum cleaners as \( X \).

2. At the orange house, she sold half of what was left after selling to the green and red houses. Therefore, before selling to the orange house, she must have had twice the amount she sold there (which is half of what remained). 

   Thus, before the orange sale, she had \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) vacuum cleaners (since 5 are left after the orange sale).

3. Before reaching the orange house, she sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house. Hence, before this sale, she would've had \( 10 + 2 = 12 \) vacuum cleaners.

4. Finally, she sold one-third of her original inventory at the green house. This means that before this sale, she had three times the amount she sold there (one-third of the original stock).

Therefore, before giving away the ones at the green house, she had \( 12 \times 3 = 36 \) vacuum cleaners.

Hence, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners."
"To find out what percentage of the entire student body enrolled in hip-hop dance:

1. First, calculate the number of students enrolled in contemporary dance:
   Contemporary dance students = Total students * Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance
   Contemporary dance students = 20 * 20%
   Contemporary dance students = 20 * (20/100)
   Contemporary dance students = 4

2. Next, subtract those who are enrolled in contemporary dance from the total number of students:
   Remaining students = Total students - Students in contemporary dance
   Remaining students = 20 - 4
   Remaining students = 16

3. Calculate the number of students enrolled in jazz dance:
   Jazz dance students = Remaining students * Percentage enrolled in jazz dance
   Jazz dance students = 16 * 25%
   Jazz dance students = 16 * (25/100)
   Jazz dance students = 4

4. Finally, subtract the number of students enrolled in contemporary and jazz dances from the total to get the number enrolled in hip-hop dance:
   Hip-hop dance students = Total students - (Contemporary dance students + Jazz dance students)
   Hip-hop dance students = 20 - (4 + 4)
   Hip-hop dance students = 20 - 8
   Hip-hop dance students = 12

Now we need to find the percentage of students enrolled in hip-hop dance relative to the total:
Hip-hop dance percentage = (Number of hip-hop dancers / Total number of students) * 100%

Let's plug in the numbers:
Hip-hop dance percentage = (12 / 20) * 100%
Hip-hop dance percentage = 0.6 * 100%
Hip-hop dance percentage = 60%

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase plan yields a higher profit, we need to calculate the expected value (EV) of both purchases based on their respective price increases over the course of the month.

### Jewelry Purchase Plan

1. **Initial Value**: $5,000
2. **Price Increase**: 2.5%

   \[
   \text{Expected Value} (\text{Jewelry}) = \$5,000 \times (1 + 0.025)
   \]

\[
\text{Expected Value} (\text{Jewelry}) = \$5,000 \times 1.025 = \$5,125
\]

### Electronic Gadgets Purchase Plan

1. **Initial Value**: $8,000
2. **Price Increase**: 1.2%

   \[
   \text{Expected Value} (\text{Gadgets}) = \$8,000 \times (1 + 0.012)
   \]

\[
\text{Expected Value} (\text{Gadgets}) = \$8,000 \times 1.012 = \$8,096
\]

### Conclusion

Comparing the expected values:

- Jewelry Expected Value: \$5,125
- Electronics Expected Value: \$8,096

Since \$8,096 > \$5,125, the electronic gadget purchase yields a greater profit. Therefore, the merchant should choose the electronics gadgets purchase plan to maximize profit."
"On the first day, when the trains traveled westward, each train covered a distance of 80 miles. 

So, on the first day, each train covered 80 miles.

On the second day, when the trains traveled northward, each train covered an additional 150 miles.

Therefore, over the two days, each train covered a total distance of:

\( \text{Total Distance} = \text{Distance on First Day (Westward)} + \text{Distance on Second Day (Northward)} \)

\( \text{Total Distance} = 80\, \text{miles} + 150\, \text{miles} \)

\( \text{Total Distance} = 230\, \text{miles} \)

Each train covers 230 miles over the two days."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to first find out how much she earns from teaching and from being a cheerleading coach separately, then add those amounts together.

For teaching:

She earns $20 per hour and works 35 hours a week, so her weekly earnings from teaching are:
$20/hour × 35 hours/week = $700/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly earnings from teaching are:
$700/week × 50 weeks/year = $35,000/year

For being a cheerleading coach:

She earns $30 per hour and works 15 hours a week, so her weekly earnings from coaching are:
$30/hour × 15 hours/week = $450/week

Since she works 50 weeks a year, her yearly earnings from coaching are:
$450/week × 50 weeks/year = $22,500/year

Now we add both her teaching and coaching earnings to get her total annual salary:

Total annual salary = Earnings from teaching + Earnings from coaching
Total annual salary = $35,000/year + $22,500/year = $57,500/year

So Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To determine how many dozen eggs Claire will consume in 4 weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs used per week.
2. Multiply by the number of weeks (4).

First, let's find out how many eggs Claire uses in one week. Since she makes a 3-egg omelet every morning, and there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Eggs per week} = 3 \times 7 = 21 \]

Next, we calculate how many eggs she consumes over 4 weeks:

\[ \text{Eggs in 4 weeks} = 21 \times 4 = 84 \]

Now, since we need to convert this into dozens of eggs, remember that 1 dozen equals 12 eggs:

\[ \text{Dozen of eggs} = \frac{84}{12} = 7 \]

So, Claire will consume 7 dozen eggs in 4 weeks."
"First, we calculate Marissa's total walking time. We know she walked the first 4 miles in 1 hour and the next 2 miles in another hour. Therefore, her total walking time was:

\[ 1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we determine the remaining distance Marissa needs to cover. The entire trail is 12 miles long, and she has already covered 4 + 2 = 6 miles. Thus, the remaining distance is:

\[ 12 \text{ miles} - 6 \text{ miles} = 6 \text{ miles} \]

Now, we need to find out the required walking speed to complete this remaining distance within the same amount of time, which is 2 hours. Using the formula for speed (\( \text{speed} = \frac{\text{distance}}{\text{time}} \)), we get:

\[ \text{Required Speed} = \frac{6 \text{ miles}}{2 \text{ hours}} = 3 \text{ miles per hour} \]

So, Marissa needs to walk at a speed of 3 miles per hour to maintain an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire hike."
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in each drink before any spills:

For the orange drink:
10 liters × (2/3) = 20/3 ≈ 6.67 liters

For the pineapple drink:
15 liters × (3/5) = 4.5 liters

Now we know that when you mix these drinks together, the total volume remains constant because the volumes add up correctly without needing to account for spillage initially. However, since you spilled 1 liter of the orange drink, the actual mixing will result in a smaller total volume than expected due to the spillage.

So, after adding both drinks, the new total volume becomes:

10 liters (orange) + 15 liters (pineapple) - 1 liter (spilled) = 24 liters

This matches your statement that the final mixture contains 24 liters. The proportion of water in the mixture doesn't change because the water content in each drink was consistent. 

To find out how much water is in the final mixture, we use the initial proportions of water:

Total water = Water from orange drink + Water from pineapple drink
= (20/3) + 4.5
= 20/3 + 13.5/3
= 33.5/3 ≈ 11.17 liters

Therefore, approximately 11.17 liters of water remain in the final mixture."
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Raymond's current age.
2. Calculate how long it took for Raymond to have a son.
3. Find out when Raymond's son was born based on Samantha's current age.

First, let's find Raymond's current age. Since Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, and Samantha is currently 31 years old, Raymond must be \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

Next, we know that Raymond had a son at the age of 23. This means the son was born 23 - 25 = -2 years ago (which indicates an error since ages cannot be negative). Let's correct this by understanding that Raymond had a son at the age of 23, meaning the son turned 23 exactly one year after Raymond was 23. Therefore, the son was born 23 - 25 + 1 = 9 years ago.

So, Raymond's son was born 9 years ago."
"To find out how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, let's break down the information given:

1. **First 3 customers:** Each of these 3 customers buys 1 DVD.
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. **Next 2 customers:** Each of these 2 customers buys 2 DVDs.
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. **Last 3 customers:** None of these 3 customers buys any DVDs.

Now we add up all the DVDs sold by the different groups:

\[
3 \text{ DVDs (first group)} + 4 \text{ DVDs (second group)} + 0 \text{ DVDs (third group)} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

So, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To determine how much shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle burned during this period.

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of:

5 hours - 1 hour = 4 hours

Since the candle melts by 2 centimeters per hour while it burns, over a 4-hour period, the candle will melt by:

4 hours × 2 cm/hour = 8 cm

So, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter than its original length."
"To find the original price of the book before the discount, we need to divide Kyle's purchase amount by the discount rate percentage (expressed as a decimal).

Kyle paid $19.50 after a 25% discount, which means he paid 75% of the original price (since 100% - 25% = 75%).

Let \( P \) represent the original price of the book. We can set up the equation:

\[ 0.75P = \$19.50 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = \$26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items other than the pizzas:

- The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
- The cost of 5 packs of milk at $3 each is \(5 \times \$3 = \$15\).
- The cost of 4 apples at $1.50 each is \(4 \times \$1.50 = \$6\).

Now, let's add these amounts together to find out how much was spent on non-pizza items:
\[ \$12 + \$15 + \$6 = \$33 \]

Marie paid a total of $50, so the amount spent on pizzas is:
\[ \$50 - \$33 = \$17 \]

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we divide the total amount spent on pizzas by the price per box:
\[ \frac{\$17}{\$8.50} = 2 \]

Therefore, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To calculate the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to multiply the cost of each type of item by the quantity purchased and then add them together.

For shorts:
3 pairs × $16.50/pair = $49.50

For pants:
3 pairs × $22.50/pair = $67.50

For shoes:
3 pairs × $42.00/pair = $126.00

Now, let's add these amounts together:

$49.50 (shorts) + $67.50 (pants) + $126.00 (shoes) = $243.00

So, Mishka spent a total of $243.00 on all the clothing items."
"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of servings Cynthia consumes in 60 days:**
   - Cynthia eats 1 serving per night.
   - There are 30 nights in 60 days (since \( \frac{60}{2} = 30 \)).
   - Therefore, Cynthia will consume \( 1 \times 30 = 30 \) servings in 60 days.

2. **Determine the number of cartons needed:**
   - Each carton contains 15 servings.
   - To find out how many cartons are needed, divide the total number of servings by the number of servings per carton:
     \[
     \frac{30 \text{ servings}}{15 \text{ servings/carton}} = 2 \text{ cartons}
     \]

3. **Calculate the total cost:**
   - Each carton costs $4.00.
   - Multiply the number of cartons by the cost per carton:
     \[
     2 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$8.00
     \]

Thus, Cynthia will spend \(\boxed{8}\) dollars on ice cream after 60 days."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of his first stop from the distance of his second stop:

Distance between first and second stop = Distance of second stop - Distance of first stop

First stop: 20 miles
Second stop: 15 miles before the end of the trip (which means it's 60 - 15 = 45 miles away)

Now let's calculate:

Distance between first and second stop = 45 miles - 20 miles = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we know that one pair of heels costs $33. Since another pair of heels costs twice as much, it would cost \(2 \times \$33 = \$66\).

2. The question states that these two pairs of heels together cost five dollars less than the boots. Therefore, if you add the cost of both pairs of heels, you get \(\$33 + \$66 = \$99\). This amount represents five dollars less than what the boots cost.

3. To find out how much the boots cost, we need to add those five dollars back to the sum of the two pairs of heels' prices: \(\$99 + \$5 = \$104\).

So, the boots cost $104."
"Let's denote Darrell's age as \(7x\) and Allen's age as \(11x\), where \(x\) is a common multiplier. According to the problem, the sum of their ages is 162:

\[7x + 11x = 162\]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[18x = 162\]

Now we solve for \(x\):

\[x = \frac{162}{18} = 9\]

So, Darrell's current age is \(7x = 7 \times 9 = 63\) and Allen's current age is \(11x = 11 \times 9 = 99\).

To find out what Allen's age will be 10 years from now, we add 10 to his current age:

\[99 + 10 = 109\]

Therefore, Allen's age 10 years from now will be 109 years old."
"To find the average guess, we need to add up all three guesses and then divide by the number of guesses (which is 3).

First, let's calculate each friend's guess:

Friend 1 guessed 80 jelly beans.

Friend 2 guessed 20 more than half the first guess, which would be calculated as follows:
Half of Friend 1's guess: \( \frac{80}{2} = 40 \)
Add 20 more: \( 40 + 20 = 60 \)

So, Friend 2 guessed 60 jelly beans.

Friend 3 guessed 25% more than the first guess, which would be calculated as follows:
25% of Friend 1's guess: \( 80 \times \frac{25}{100} = 20 \)
Add this amount to the original guess: \( 80 + 20 = 100 \)

So, Friend 3 guessed 100 jelly beans.

Now, let's add these guesses together and divide by 3 to get the average:

Total guesses: \( 80 + 60 + 100 = 240 \)
Average guess: \( \frac{240}{3} = 80 \)

Therefore, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To calculate the number of hours John spends on caring for the dogs each week, we need to consider both walking the dogs and taking care of their business.

First, let's find out how long it takes him to take care of all 10 dogs:

Each dog requires 0.5 hours per day. Since there are 10 dogs, the time required per day is:

\( 10 \text{ dogs} \times 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \)

Now, to find out how long it takes to care for them over the course of a week (assuming one week has 7 days):

\( 5 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 35 \text{ hours/week} \)

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

According to the problem, we know that:

S + G = 110 (total number of coins)
And also, G = S + 30 (there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins)

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:

S + (S + 30) = 110

Combine like terms:

2S + 30 = 110

Subtract 30 from both sides:

2S = 80

Divide by 2:

S = 40

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find out how many gold coins there are using the second equation:

G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"To find out how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many jewels Aaron has.
2. Use the number of jewels Aaron has to determine how many jewels Siobhan has.

First, let's calculate how many jewels Aaron has:

Since Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, and Raymond has 40 jewels, we start by finding half of Raymond's jewels:

Half of 40 jewels = \( \frac{40}{2} = 20 \) jewels

Now add the additional 5 jewels that Aaron has:

Aaron's jewels = \( 20 + 5 = 25 \) jewels

Next, we'll figure out how many jewels Siobhan has. Since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron:

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2 = \( 25 - 2 = 23 \) jewels

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"To find out how many total points Mike scored, we need to calculate the number of points he scored in the second 20-minute period and then add it to the points he scored in the first 20 minutes.

In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

For the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more than the first 20 minutes. To calculate this:

First, find 25% of 4 points:

\( \frac{25}{100} \times 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \)

Then add this to the original 4 points to get the total points for the second 20 minutes:

\( 4 + 1 = 5 \)

Now, add the points from both periods together:

\( 4 (first 20 minutes) + 5 (second 20 minutes) = 9 \)

So, Mike scored a total of 9 points."
"To determine how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of yogurts Terry consumes per day.
2. Determine the total number of yogurts consumed over 30 days.
3. Find out how many sets of 4 yogurts make up this total.
4. Calculate the total cost based on the price per set of 4 yogurts.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Number of yogurts Terry consumes per day**: 
   \[
   2 \text{ yogurts/day}
   \]

2. **Total number of yogurts consumed over 30 days**:
   \[
   2 \text{ yogurts/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 60 \text{ yogurts}
   \]

3. **Number of sets of 4 yogurts in 60 yogurts**:
   \[
   \frac{60 \text{ yogurts}}{4 \text{ yogurts/set}} = 15 \text{ sets}
   \]

4. **Calculate the total cost**:
   Since each set costs $5.00, the total cost for 15 sets is:
   \[
   15 \text{ sets} \times \$5.00/\text{set} = \$75.00
   \]

So, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:**
   \[
   \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \text{ sets} \times \$15 \text{ per set}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = \$195
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of money John used to buy the video games:**
   \[
   \text{Cost of one video game} = \$20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Total cost of 8 video games} = 8 \times 20 = \$160
   \]

3. **Calculate the remaining money after buying the video games:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = \text{Total money from Lego sets} - \text{Total cost of video games}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining money} = 195 - 160 = \$35
   \]

4. **Determine how many Lego sets John has left:**
   \[
   \text{Number of Lego sets} = \frac{\text{Remaining money}}{\text{Price per Lego set}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of Lego sets} = \frac{35}{15}
   \]

Since 35 divided by 15 equals approximately 2.33, this indicates a potential mistake or misinterpretation because you cannot have a fraction of a Lego set. Let's recheck our calculations:

Rechecking step-by-step:
- Total money from Lego sets: \( 13 \times 15 = 195 \)
- Cost of 8 video games: \( 8 \times 20 = 160 \)

Thus, John would actually owe \( 195 - 160 = 35 \) dollars if he didn't have enough. Therefore, the correct number of Lego sets he could afford is 2 (since he must spend exactly what he earned).

So, John still has \( 13 - 2 = 11 \) Lego sets left.

**Final Answer:** John has 11 Lego sets left."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total time he spends running over the three days and then divide the distance by this time.

First, let's determine the number of hours John runs on each day:

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.
On the second and third days, he runs half as much as the first day. Since he runs 3 hours on the first day, on the second and third days he would run for \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours each day.

Now, let's add up the total hours he runs over the three days:

\[ 3 \text{ (first day)} + 1.5 \text{ (second day)} + 1.5 \text{ (third day)} = 6 \text{ hours} \]

Next, we'll calculate his average speed by dividing the total distance by the total time:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]
\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{60 \text{ miles}}{6 \text{ hours}} \]
\[ \text{Average Speed} = 10 \text{ mph} \]

So, John runs at an average speed of 10 miles per hour."
"First, let's determine Dana's walking speed:

If skipping is half as fast as running, then running would be twice the speed of skipping. Since skipping at 3 mph means running at 6 mph (half of 12), we know that walking must be slower than this. However, since no other information about walking speeds was given, we'll assume it's consistent with the problem statement or context provided which doesn't specify any differences between walking and running speeds beyond what's already stated.

Next, calculate Dana's running speed:

Since Dana runs four times faster than she walks, if walking speed is 'w', then running speed is '4w'. Given that walking speed 'w' is equal to 3 mph, running speed becomes 12 mph.

Now, calculate the distance Dana covers during her running phase:

She spends one-third of her six-hour period running. Thus, the time spent running is \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) hours. 

Distance covered while running = Speed × Time

Distance covered while running = 12 mph × 2 hours = 24 miles.

Then calculate the distance covered during her walking phase:

She spends two-thirds of her six-hour period walking. Thus, the time spent walking is \( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \) hours.

Distance covered while walking = Speed × Time

Distance covered while walking = 3 mph × 2 hours = 6 miles.

Finally, add both distances together to get the total distance traveled:

Total distance = Distance while running + Distance while walking

Total distance = 24 miles + 6 miles = 30 miles.

Therefore, Dana travels 30 miles in six hours."
"To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how old Ben's iPhone is based on the information given.
2. Use the age of Ben's iPhone to determine how old Brandon's iPhone is.

First, let's calculate the age of Ben's iPhone. The problem states that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone. Since Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old, we can calculate Ben's iPhone as follows:

\[ \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times \text{Age of Suzy's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \]

Now, we know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone. Therefore, we can calculate the age of Brandon's iPhone by multiplying the age of Ben's iPhone by 4:

\[ \text{Age of Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times \text{Age of Ben's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \]

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when she doesn't hold it. Since the regular distance is 400 feet, the distance with the gemstone would be 400 * 3 = 1200 feet. The maximum distance the dragon can breathe fire is 1000 feet. Therefore, if Polly stands 1200 feet away from the dragon, she will be able to hit it with the gold javelin even though it's within the dragon's range. 

So, the answer is 1200 feet."
"To determine how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pieces of pie Grandma Jones initially baked.
2. Determine the total number of pieces of pie that were consumed.
3. Find out how many pieces were taken by the guests.

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of pie Grandma Jones baked. Since she baked 5 apple pies and each pie was cut into 8 pieces, the total number of pieces is:
\[ 5 \text{ pies} \times 8 \text{ pieces per pie} = 40 \text{ pieces} \]

Next, we know that at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces of pie remaining. This means that the number of pieces taken by the guests is the difference between the total number of pieces baked and the number of pieces remaining:
\[ 40 \text{ pieces} - 14 \text{ pieces} = 26 \text{ pieces} \]

So, the number of pieces of pie taken by the guests is:
\[
\boxed{26}
\]"
"To find out how many grams of chips you can consume while staying within your daily calorie target, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Calories Per Bag:** 
   Since each serving contains 250 calories and there are 5 servings in a 300g bag, the total calories in the bag would be \(250 \times 5 = 1250\) calories.

2. **Determine Remaining Calories You Can Consume Daily:**
   Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories. Since you've already consumed 1800 calories, you can consume an additional 200 calories (2000 - 1800).

3. **Find Out How Many Servings You Can Eat With The Additional Calories:**
   Given that one serving provides 250 calories, with 200 additional calories available, you can eat \(200 / 250 = 0.8\) servings.

4. **Convert Grams of Chips to Calories:**
   A full serving weighs 300g, which translates to \(300 \times 250 = 75,000\) calories.

5. **Calculate How Much Chips You Can Eat Based on Weight:**
   Since you're consuming 0.8 servings, you'd be eating \(0.8 \times 300 = 240\) grams of chips.

So, based on this information, you can consume approximately 240 grams of chips while staying within your daily calorie limit of 2000 calories."
"To determine Charlie's net profit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of candles Charlie can produce from one pound of beeswax:**
   - Charlie makes 10 tapered candles per pound of beeswax.

2. **Determine the revenue from selling 20 candles:**
   - Each candle sells for $2.00.
   - Revenue from 20 candles: \( 20 \text{ candles} \times \$2.00/\text{candle} = \$40.00 \).

3. **Calculate the cost of making 20 candles:**
   - The cost to make one pound of beeswax and wicks is $10.00.
   - Since it takes 1 pound of beeswax and wicks to make 10 candles, it will take 2 pounds (or 2 pounds of beeswax and wicks) to make 20 candles.
   - Total cost for 20 candles: \( 2 \text{ pounds} \times \$10.00/\text{pound} = \$20.00 \).

4. **Compute the net profit:**
   - Net profit is calculated by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue.
   - Net profit: \( \$40.00 - \$20.00 = \$20.00 \).

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles is \(\boxed{\$20.00}\)."
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the time it takes to complete one article (which is 4 hours).

**Monday:**  
She wrote 5 articles.  
Time taken: \( 5 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 20 \text{ hours} \)

**Tuesday:**  
She wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday.  
\( \frac{2}{5} \) of 5 articles is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 2 \).  
So, she wrote \( 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.  
Time taken: \( 7 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 28 \text{ hours} \)

**Wednesday:**  
She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.  
Twice 7 articles is \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) articles.  
Time taken: \( 14 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 56 \text{ hours} \)

Now, add up the time spent on all three days:

Total time spent: 
\( 20 \text{ hours} + 28 \text{ hours} + 56 \text{ hours} = 104 \text{ hours} \)

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over the three days."
"To find out how many Post-it notes were in the package that Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Initial Notes**: Candice initially had 80 Post-it notes in her purse.

2. **Notes Purchased**: Let's denote the number of Post-it notes in the package as \( x \).

3. **Notes Used at Work**: Candice used one Post-it note per cup of coffee. Since she used this on 220 cups, she used 220 Post-it notes.

4. **Total Notes Remaining**: We know that after all transactions, she had 23 Post-it notes left. Therefore, the equation representing this situation is:
   \[
   (80 + x) - 220 = 23
   \]

5. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   \[
   80 + x - 220 = 23 \\
   x - 140 = 23 \\
   x = 23 + 140 \\
   x = 163
   \]

So, the package contained 163 Post-it notes."
"To solve this problem, we need to determine how much John spends on both red and blue ties.

First, let's find out how many blue ties John bought:

He bought 20 blue ties since it costs him $200 and each tie costs $40.

Next, let's calculate the cost per blue tie:

Each blue tie costs $40.

Now, let's find out how many red ties John bought:

Since he bought twice as many red ties as blue ties, he bought 20 x 2 = 40 red ties.

Finally, let's calculate the cost of all the ties:

For blue ties, he spent $200.

For red ties, each one costs $40 (since he bought twice as many), so 40 ties would cost 40 x $40 = $1600.

Adding up the cost of both types of ties gives us the total amount spent:

$200 (blue ties) + $1600 (red ties) = $1800

So, John spent a total of $1800 on ties."
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit. Let's use inches since the length of one piece is given in inches (6 inches). 

First, let's convert the initial length of the wire from feet to inches:

\[ 4 \text{ feet} \times 12 \text{ inches/foot} = 48 \text{ inches} \]

Now, we know that the wire is cut into pieces of 6 inches each. To find out how many pieces she obtained, we divide the total length by the length of each piece:

\[ \frac{48 \text{ inches}}{6 \text{ inches/piece}} = 8 \text{ pieces} \]

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"To find out the total number of unoccupied units in the building, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of units in the building.
2. Determine the number of units that are occupied.
3. Subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to get the number of unoccupied units.

Firstly, let's calculate the total number of units in the building:

Total number of units = Floors × Units per floor

= 15 floors × 8 units per floor

= 120 units

Now, let's determine the number of units that are occupied:

Occupied units = Total number of units × Occupancy rate

= 120 units × 3/4

= 90 units

Finally, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units to get the number of unoccupied units:

Unoccupied units = Total number of units − Occupied units

= 120 units − 90 units

= 30 units

So, there are a total of 30 unoccupied units in the building."
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of eggs produced per day by all the chickens.
2. Convert the daily egg production into dozens (since the selling price is given per dozen).
3. Calculate the weekly earnings based on the daily earnings.

Let's go through each step:

1. **Daily Egg Production**:
   - Number of chickens: 1 (let's assume it's one chicken as it doesn't specify otherwise)
   - Eggs per day per chicken: 252

   Total eggs per day = 1 chicken × 252 eggs/chicken/day = 252 eggs/day

2. **Convert Daily Eggs to Dozens**:
   - Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen,
   - Dozens of eggs per day = 252 eggs / 12 eggs/dozen = 21 dozens/day

3. **Weekly Earnings Calculation**:
   - The price per dozen eggs is $2,
   - Weekly earnings = 21 dozens/day × $2/dozen/day = $42/week

Therefore, Lloyd makes $42 on eggs per week."
"To calculate the time it takes Tom to travel back, we need to know the distance between point 1 and point 4. Since this information is not provided, I cannot give an exact time. However, if you could provide the distance or any other relevant details, I would be happy to help you calculate the time it takes for Tom to return home."
"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we first calculate the weight reduction caused by removing the comic books. Since each comic book weighs \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound and he removes 30 comic books, the total weight removed due to the comic books is:

\[ 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Since Uriah wants to reduce the weight of his book bag by 15 pounds, we subtract the weight of the comic books from the desired reduction:

\[ 15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds} \]

Now, we need to find out how many toys weigh 0.5 pounds each and add up to 7.5 pounds. Let \( x \) represent the number of toys. We set up the equation:

\[ 0.5x = 7.5 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{7.5}{0.5} = 15 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 toys to reach a total weight reduction of 15 pounds."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on the day with higher revenue, we need to calculate the total earnings for both days.

**Thursday's Earnings Calculation:**
- Trucks: 6 tires × $60/tire = $360
- Cars: 4 tires × $40/tire = $160

Total earnings for Thursday = $360 (trucks) + $160 (cars) = $520

**Friday's Earnings Calculation:**
- Trucks: 0 tires × $60/tire = $0 (since no truck tires were repaired)
- Cars: 12 tires × $40/tire = $480

Total earnings for Friday = $0 (trucks) + $480 (cars) = $480

Now, let's compare the total earnings:

Difference in revenue between Friday and Thursday = Total earnings on Friday - Total earnings on Thursday
= $480 - $520 = -$40

On Friday, the mechanic earned less than on Thursday by $40. Therefore, there was not a difference in revenue; instead, the mechanic earned $40 less on Friday compared to Thursday."
"To determine the total number of kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to calculate the number of kittens each cat has given and then sum these amounts.

First, let's find out how many kittens Patchy (the first cat) has:

Since Patchy has had three times the number of adopted kittens as those taken by the other cats, and we know the other two cats took a total of 12 kittens, we can set up the following equation:

\[ \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 3 \times (\text{Kittens from Trixie}) \]

Given that the other two cats took 12 kittens, we can substitute this into our equation:

\[ \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 3 \times 12 \]
\[ \text{Kittens from Patchy} = 36 \]

Now, we add the kittens from both Patchy and Trixie together:

\[ \text{Total Kittens} = \text{Kittens from Patchy} + \text{Kittens from Trixie} \]
\[ \text{Total Kittens} = 36 + 12 \]
\[ \text{Total Kittens} = 48 \]

Therefore, the Doubtfire family now has 48 kittens."
"To determine how many bags Jean can fill, we first need to calculate the number of lollipops Jean has left after eating 2. 

Starting with 30 lollipops and subtracting the 2 that Jean ate:

\[ 30 - 2 = 28 \]

Now that we know Jean has 28 lollipops left, we want to figure out how many sets of 2 lollipops she can make:

\[ \frac{28}{2} = 14 \]

So, Jean can fill 14 bags with 2 lollipops each."
"To find out how many times Peter can go to the movies this week, we need to calculate how many tickets and popcorns he can afford given his budget.

First, let's determine how many tickets Peter can buy:

Tickets per movie = $7

Number of tickets Peter can buy = Total money / Cost per ticket
= $42 / $7
= 6 tickets

Now, let's calculate how many popcorns Peter can buy:

Popcorn per movie = $7

Number of popcorns Peter can buy = Total money / Cost per popcorn
= $42 / $7
= 6 popcorns

Each time Peter goes to the movies, he spends both a ticket and popcorn, which totals $14 ($7 for the ticket plus $7 for the popcorn).

Now, we'll divide the total number of movies by the total cost per visit:

Total movies = Number of tickets + Number of popcorns
= 6 + 6
= 12 movies

Total cost per movie = $14

So, Peter can go to the movies 12 times with his $42 budget."
"To determine the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the combined weight of the driver and the empty truck:**
   \[
   \text{Combined weight} = 3755 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's capacity to find the remaining weight capacity:**
   \[
   \text{Remaining weight capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds}
   \]

3. **Determine the weight of one box:**
   \[
   \text{Weight of one box} = 15 \text{ pounds}
   \]

4. **Calculate the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded by dividing the remaining weight capacity by the weight of one box:**
   \[
   \text{Maximum number of boxes} = \frac{\text{Remaining weight capacity}}{\text{Weight of one box}} = \frac{1245 \text{ pounds}}{15 \text{ pounds/box}}
   \]
   
   Performing the division:
   \[
   \frac{1245}{15} = 83
   \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is **83**."
"To find the final price of Stephen's groceries after all additional charges, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the 25% service charge on the original bill.
2. Add the delivery fees.
3. Add the tip.
4. Sum up all amounts to get the final price.

Let's go through each step one by one.

### Step 1: Calculate the Service Charge

The original bill was $40.00, and the service charge is 25%.

\[
\text{Service Charge} = \frac{25}{100} \times 40 = 0.25 \times 40 = \$10.00
\]

### Step 2: Add Delivery Fees

The delivery fees amount to $3.00.

\[
\text{Total Before Tip} = \text{Original Bill} + \text{Service Charge} + \text{Delivery Fees}
\]
\[
= 40 + 10 + 3 = \$53.00
\]

### Step 3: Add the Tip

The tip is $4.00.

\[
\text{Final Price} = \text{Total Before Tip} + \text{Tip}
\]
\[
= 53 + 4 = \$57.00
\]

Therefore, the final price of Stephen's groceries after all additional fees is **$57.00**."
"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, you need to add the number of clusters times the number of fruits per cluster to the number of scattered fruits:

Total raspberries = (Clusters × Fruits/Cluster) + Scattered Fruits

Plugging in the numbers:

Total raspberries = (6 clusters × 20 fruits/cluster) + 67 scattered fruits

Total raspberries = (120 fruits) + 67 fruits

Total raspberries = 187

So there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush."
"To find out how many oranges are good, we need to first determine the percentage of ripe oranges since we know that 20% are unripe and 2 are sour. This leaves us with 80% as ripe oranges (since all other types sum up to 100%).

Given that there are 25 oranges in total:

Number of ripe oranges = Total number of oranges * Percentage of ripe oranges

So,

Number of ripe oranges = 25 * 0.8 = 20

Therefore, there are 20 good oranges in the basket."
"First, let's add up the costs Janet incurred:

Material cost: $500
Construction cost: $800

Total cost before insurance: $500 (material) + $800 (construction) = $1300

Next, we calculate the amount Janet needs to pay for insurance:

Insurance cost: 10% of total cost before insurance
= 0.10 × $1300 = $130

Now, let's add the insurance cost to the original total cost to find out how much Janet paid:

Total payment = Total cost before insurance + Insurance cost
= $1300 + $130 = $1430

So, Janet paid a total of $1430 for the brooch."
"Let's break down the calculation step by step:

1. **Marcy's Annual Pension Calculation:**
   - Marcy worked for a full 40 years before becoming eligible for the increased pension rate.
   - Her initial pension was $50,000 per year.
   
2. **Increase in Pension Rate:**
   - Starting after 20 years (i.e., after working for 20 years), Marcy starts receiving 5% of the value of her pension annually.
   - To calculate this increase, we need to know the total amount of her pension over 40 years.

3. **Total Pension Over 40 Years:**
   - Let \( P \) represent the initial annual pension.
   - Since Marcy worked for 40 years without any increases, her total pension over these years would be \( 40P \).

4. **Increase Due to Age:**
   - The problem states that starting after 20 years, Marcy receives 5% of her initial pension as an additional benefit.
   - Therefore, the additional amount received after 20 years is \( 0.05P \).

5. **Annual Pension Calculation:**
   - Marcy's total pension over 40 years includes both her initial pension and the 5% increase.
   - Thus, her total pension over 40 years is \( 40P + 0.05P = 40.05P \).

6. **Annual Pension After 20 Years:**
   - We know that after 20 years, Marcy's annual pension is equal to her total pension over 40 years divided by 20.
   - This gives us the equation: 
     \[
     \text{Annual Pension} = \frac{40.05P}{20}
     \]

7. **Simplify the Equation:**
   - Simplify the fraction:
     \[
     \text{Annual Pension} = 2.0025P
     \]

Since we don't have the exact value of \( P \) (the initial annual pension), we cannot provide a numerical answer. However, if you have the value of \( P \), you can substitute it into the formula to find the exact amount.

For example, if Marcy's initial annual pension (\( P \)) was $50,000:
\[
\text{Annual Pension} ="
"To find out the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the calculation into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the monthly charge for the second half of the year:**
   The original monthly charge was $140. With a 10% discount, the new monthly charge for the second half of the year would be \( 140 \times (1 - 0.10) = 140 \times 0.90 = \$126 \).

2. **Calculate the total cost for the first half of the year:**
   Since there are 6 months in the first half of the year, the total cost for the first half would be \( 140 \times 6 = \$840 \).

3. **Calculate the total cost for the second half of the year:**
   Similarly, since there are another 6 months in the second half of the year, the total cost for the second half would also be \( 126 \times 6 = \$756 \).

4. **Add both halves together to get the total amount paid for the year:**
   Adding the costs from both halves of the year gives us \( 840 + 756 = \$1,596 \).

Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena had paid a total of $1,596 for the streaming service."
"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to first calculate the number of full tanks she has already used and then add the remaining distance she has traveled.

First, let's find out how many full tanks Sophia has driven:

\[
\text{Full tanks} = \frac{\text{Total miles traveled}}{\text{Miles per tank}}
\]

Since Sophia has traveled 100 miles and needs 4 gallons to refill the tank, we assume her car uses approximately 1 gallon of gas per mile (a common assumption when not specified otherwise). Therefore:

\[
\text{Full tanks} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ full tanks}
\]

Next, we'll consider the remaining distance she can travel before needing another tank:

\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 100 \text{ miles} - (\text{Miles traveled} \times \text{Miles per tank})
\]
\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 100 \text{ miles} - (100 \text{ miles} \times 1 \text{ mile/gallon})
\]
\[
\text{Remaining distance} = 100 \text{ miles} - 100 \text{ miles} = 0 \text{ miles}
\]

Thus, if Sophia continues driving without refilling her tank until she runs out of fuel, she will have driven exactly 100 miles before running out of gas.

However, considering the information given about the car's capacity, which is 12 gallons, we must account for any potential partial tank usage. To determine this, we divide the available gas by the capacity of one tank:

\[
\text{Available gas} = 12 \text{ gallons}
\]
\[
\text{Number of full tanks} = \frac{12 \text{ gallons}}{4 \text{ gallons/tank}} = 3 \text{ full tanks}
\]

Therefore, the maximum distance Sophia can drive on a full tank is calculated as follows:

\[
\text{Maximum distance} = 3 \text{ full tanks} \times 100 \text{ miles/full tank} = 300 \text{ miles}
\]

So, Sophia can potentially drive 300 miles on a single tank of gas"
"First, let's determine how long Jim spends reading each time he goes to bed:

He watches 2 hours of TV first, then reads for half as long as that, which is \( \frac{2}{2} = 1 \) hour.

So, for one session, he spends 2 hours watching TV plus 1 hour reading, which totals 3 hours.

Now we need to find out how many hours he spends doing this over 4 weeks. Since he repeats this process 3 times a week, it would be \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) hours per week.

Finally, we multiply this weekly amount by 4 to get the total number of hours spent over 4 weeks:

\( 9 \text{ hours/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 36 \text{ hours} \)

Therefore, Jim spends 36 hours watching TV and reading in 4 weeks."
"To find out the total number of people who have all the schools sent, we need to consider both the teams and the coaches.

Each school sends:

- 5 girls' basketball players
- 5 boys' basketball players 
- 2 coaches

So, each school sends a total of \( 5 \text{ (girls)} + 5 \text{ (boys)} + 2 \text{ (coaches)} = 12 \) people.

Since there are 4 schools, the total number of people sent by all the schools combined would be \( 4 \times 12 \).

\( 4 \times 12 = 48 \)

Therefore, there are a total of 48 people who have all the schools sent."
"To find out the total number of gems in the treasure chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem separately and then add them together.

1. **Diamonds**: The number of diamonds is given as 175.

2. **Rubies**: There are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Since there are 175 diamonds, the number of rubies would be:

   \[
   \text{Number of Rubies} = \text{Number of Diamonds} - 35
   \]

   Substituting the value of diamonds:

   \[
   \text{Number of Rubies} = 175 - 35 = 140
   \]

3. **Emeralds**: The number of emeralds is twice the number of rubies. Since there are 140 rubies, the number of emeralds would be:

   \[
   \text{Number of Emeralds} = 2 \times \text{Number of Rubies}
   \]

   Substituting the value of rubies:

   \[
   \text{Number of Emeralds} = 2 \times 140 = 280
   \]

Now, let's sum up all these numbers to get the total number of gems:

\[
\text{Total Gems} = \text{Diamonds} + \text{Rubies} + \text{Emeralds}
\]

Substitute the values:

\[
\text{Total Gems} = 175 + 140 + 280
\]

Add them up:

\[
\text{Total Gems} = 595
\]

So, there are 595 gems in the treasure chest."
"To find out how many teachers there are, we need to first determine the number of boys at the school. Since there are twice as many boys as girls, we can calculate the number of boys by multiplying the number of girls by 2:

Number of Boys = Number of Girls × 2
Number of Boys = 60 × 2
Number of Boys = 120

Now that we know there are 120 boys, we can find out how many students there are in total by adding the number of boys and girls together:

Total Students = Number of Boys + Number of Girls
Total Students = 120 + 60
Total Students = 180

Since there are 5 students to every teacher, we can divide the total number of students by 5 to find out how many teachers there are:

Number of Teachers = Total Students ÷ 5
Number of Teachers = 180 ÷ 5
Number of Teachers = 36

So, there are 36 teachers at Dr. Wertz's school."
"To find out how much money Bailey started with, we need to subtract the total amount she received as an allowance from the total amount she had at the end.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money Bailey received as an allowance over 8 weeks:

\[
\text{Total allowance} = \text{Weekly allowance} \times \text{Number of weeks}
\]

Given that Bailey gets $5 per week for 8 weeks, the total allowance is:

\[
\text{Total allowance} = 5 \times 8 = \$40
\]

Now, knowing that Bailey ended up with $100, we subtract the total allowance from this amount to find out how much she started with:

\[
\text{Initial amount} = \text{Final amount} - \text{Total allowance}
\]

So,

\[
\text{Initial amount} = 100 - 40 = \$60
\]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate her earnings from both weekday and weekend classes separately and then sum them up.

First, let's calculate the number of classes Judy teaches during a regular school week (Monday through Friday):

- Weekdays: \(5\) classes/day \(\times 5\) days = \(25\) classes

Next, we add the number of classes she teaches on Saturday:

- Saturday: \(8\) classes

Now, we find the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

\[
25 \text{ (weekdays)} + 8 \text{ (Saturday)} = 33 \text{ classes}
\]

Each class has 15 students, so we multiply the total number of classes by the number of students per class:

\[
33 \text{ classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 495 \text{ students}
\]

Judy charges $15.00 per student, so we calculate her total earnings:

\[
495 \text{ students} \times \$15.00/\text{student} = \$7,425
\]

Therefore, Judy makes \(\$7,425\) in one week."
"To find out the total number of instructions Kelian needs to read, we need to add up all the instructions from both recipes:

1. The first recipe has 20 instructions.
2. The second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, which means it has 2 * 20 = 40 instructions.

Now, let's add these together:

Total instructions = Instructions from first recipe + Instructions from second recipe

Total instructions = 20 + 40 = 60

So, Kelian has to read a total of 60 instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate the total amount of money Tommy raises, we need to multiply the number of brownies sold by their price per slice, and then add the product of the number of cheesecake slices sold by their price per slice.

Number of brownies sold: 43 slices

Price per brownie: $3

Total from brownies: 43 slices * $3/slice = $129

Number of cheesecake slices sold: 23 slices

Price per cheesecake: $4

Total from cheesecake: 23 slices * $4/slice = $92

Now, we add both totals together:

Total raised = Total from brownies + Total from cheesecake
           = $129 + $92
           = $221

So, Tommy raises $221 through his fundraiser."
"To calculate the monthly payment for Shiela's cell phone purchase, we need to first determine the total cost including the interest. Here's the step-by-step process:

1. **Calculate the initial cost without interest:** 
   The cost per cell phone is $150, and there are 5 cell phones. Therefore, the initial cost is \(5 \times \$150 = \$750\).

2. **Calculate the interest on the initial cost:**
   The interest rate is 2%, which means for every dollar, it becomes 1.02 dollars over time (including the original amount). To find out how much the total becomes due to this interest, you multiply by 1.02.
   
   Total interest for all units is \(5 \times \$150 \times 0.02\) since there are 5 cell phones.
   
   Let's compute this part: 
   \[
   5 \times \$150 \times 0.02 = \$150 \times 0.1 = \$15
   \]

3. **Add the interest to the initial cost to get the total cost:**
   \[
   \$750 + \$15 = \$765
   \]

4. **Divide the total cost by the number of months to get the monthly payment:**
   Since the payments are made over 3 months,
   \[
   \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255
   \]

So, Shiela will pay \$255 each month for the next three months."
"To calculate how much Artie will make, we need to first round each price to the nearest dollar and then multiply by the number of pots sold.

For marigolds:
$2.74 rounds up to $3

For petunias:
$1.87 rounds down to $1

For begonias:
$2.12 rounds up to $2

Now we'll calculate the earnings:

Marigolds: 
12 pots × $3/pot = $36

Petunias:
9 pots × $1/pot = $9

Begonias:
17 pots × $2/pot = $34

Total earnings:
$36 (marigolds) + $9 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $79

So, Artie will make $79 if he sells these quantities of flowers."
"To find the average square footage per level, we need to first determine the total square footage of all four levels combined. Given that the top level (the fourth level) has an area of 16 square feet, this represents \(2^4\) because each subsequent level has half the area of the one above it.

So, let's calculate:

- Level 4: \(2^4 = 16\) square feet
- Level 3: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8\) square feet
- Level 2: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4\) square feet
- Level 1: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2\) square feet

Now add these areas together to get the total square footage:

\[16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30\] square feet

Since there are four levels, to find the average square footage per level, divide the total by the number of levels:

\[Average = \frac{\text{Total Square Footage}}{\text{Number of Levels}} = \frac{30}{4}\]

\[Average = 7.5\]

Thus, the average square footage per level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the feeding schedule into two parts:

1. The first 180 days: The puppy eats 1 cup per day.
2. The remaining days (which make up the last 365 - 180 = 185 days): The puppy eats 2 cups per day.

First, calculate the number of cups needed for the first 180 days:
\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

Next, calculate the number of cups needed for the remaining 185 days:
\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days} = 370 \text{ cups} \]

Now, add these amounts together to find the total number of cups needed in the first year:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} + 370 \text{ cups} = 550 \text{ cups} \]

Finally, since each bag contains 110 cups, divide the total number of cups by the amount per bag to find out how many bags are needed:
\[ \frac{550 \text{ cups}}{110 \text{ cups/bag}} = 5 \text{ bags} \]

Therefore, Cecilia will use 5 bags of dog food in the first year."
"Let's denote the amount of laundry done by David as \(D\).

Given that Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David, we can write this relationship as:
\[ S = 4D \]

Where \(S\) represents the amount of laundry done by Sarah.

Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we can express this as:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2}S \]

Substituting the value of \(S\) from the previous equation into the above equation gives us:
\[ R = \frac{1}{2}(4D) \]
\[ R = 2D \]

Now, given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry (\(S = 400\)), we can find out how much laundry David does:
\[ D = \frac{S}{4} \]
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} \]
\[ D = 100 \]

So, David does 100 pounds of laundry. Since Raymond does twice as much as David:
\[ R = 2D \]
\[ R = 2 \times 100 \]
\[ R = 200 \]

Thus, the difference in the amount of laundry between Raymond and David is:
\[ Difference = R - D \]
\[ Difference = 200 - 100 \]
\[ Difference = 100 \] pounds

Therefore, the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David is 100 pounds."
"To find out how much Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price, we need to calculate the cost of buying 18 flowers using both options and then compare them.

Option 1 (package of 3 flowers):
Cost per package = $2.50
Number of packages needed = 18 / 3 = 6 packages

Total cost for option 1 = 6 packages * $2.50/package = $15.00

Option 2 (packages of 2 flowers):
Cost per package = $1.00
Number of packages needed = 18 / 2 = 9 packages

Total cost for option 2 = 9 packages * $1.00/package = $9.00

Now let's subtract the cheaper option from the more expensive one:

Savings = Total cost for option 1 - Total cost for option 2
Savings = $15.00 - $9.00
Savings = $6.00

Therefore, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To find out how much John paid for the grooming, we first need to calculate the amount of the discount and then subtract it from the original price.

Discount percentage: 30%
Original price: $100

First, convert the discount percentage into decimal form by dividing by 100:

30% / 100 = 0.30

Now multiply this by the original price:

$100 × 0.30 = $30

This is the amount of the discount. Subtract this from the original price to get the final price:

$100 - $30 = $70

So, John paid $70 for the grooming service."
"First, we need to find out how much water both girls received together:

Both girls each got 1/6 of 24 liters:

\( \frac{1}{6} \times 24 = 4 \) liters

So, the two girls together got 4 liters of water.

Next, add this amount to what the boy drank:

The boy drank 6 liters, so we add these:

\( 4 + 6 = 10 \) liters

Now subtract the total amount of water consumed by the girls and the boy from the original amount of water:

\( 24 - 10 = 14 \) liters

Therefore, there were 14 liters of water left in the container."
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to start by calculating the total number of stickers he received:

1. Charlie initially had 10 stickers.
2. He bought 21 more stickers.
3. He also got 23 stickers as a gift on his birthday.

Adding these up gives us the total number of stickers before any were given away or used:

\[ 10 \text{ (initial)} + 21 \text{ (bought)} + 23 \text{ (birthday gift)} = 54 \text{ stickers} \]

Next, we account for the stickers he gave away and used:

1. He gave 9 stickers to his sister.
2. He used 28 stickers to decorate a greeting card.

Subtracting these from the total gives us the remaining stickers:

\[ 54 \text{ (total)} - 9 \text{ (given to sister)} - 28 \text{ (used for decoration)} = 17 \text{ stickers} \]

So, Charlie has 17 stickers left."
"First find out how many pounds Alex weighs by multiplying Grace's weight by 4 and then subtracting 2: (4 * 125) - 2 = 500 - 2 = 498 pounds.
Then add both people's weights together to find the combined weight: 125 + 498 = 623 pounds.

Therefore, the answer is 623."
"To find out the total number of thorns on all the rose bushes:

1. First, calculate the total number of roses: \(3 \text{ bushes} \times 25 \text{ roses per bush} = 75 \text{ roses}\).
2. Next, calculate the total number of thorns by multiplying the total number of roses by the number of thorns per rose: \(75 \text{ roses} \times 8 \text{ thorns per rose} = 600 \text{ thorns}\).

So, there are a total of 600 thorns on all the rose bushes."
"Let's denote the number of games the team lost as L. According to the information given:

L + (L + 8) = 22

This equation represents the fact that the number of wins (W) plus the number of losses equals the total number of games (22).

Now we solve for L:

2L + 8 = 22
2L = 22 - 8
2L = 14
L = 7

So the team lost 7 games.

Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of wins (W) would be:

W = L + 8
W = 7 + 8
W = 15

Therefore, the football team won 15 games."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of vacations Gene has taken:**
   - Gene was born at age 23.
   - He has been on four vacations per year for as long as he has been alive.
   - His current age is 34.
   - Therefore, the number of years he has been alive is \( 34 - 23 = 11 \) years.
   - Since he takes four vacations per year, the total number of vacations is \( 11 \times 4 = 44 \).

2. **Determine the number of quilt blocks per vacation:**
   - Each vacation corresponds to one quilt block (one shirt).
   - Therefore, the total number of quilt blocks is equal to the total number of vacations, which is 44.

So, Gene has a total of 44 quilt blocks."
"To determine the total number of times the alarm rang throughout the day, we need to calculate the duration of each ringing session and then sum them up.

1. **First Ringing Session:**
   - Duration: 4 minutes

2. **Second Ringing Session:**
   - Duration: \(3 \times\) (Duration of the first session)
   - Duration: \(3 \times 4 = 12\) minutes

3. **Third Ringing Session:**
   - Duration: Half of the duration of the second session
   - Duration: \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) minutes

Now, let's add up all the durations:

\[
4 \text{ minutes} + 12 \text{ minutes} + 6 \text{ minutes}
\]

\[
= 22 \text{ minutes}
\]

Therefore, the total number of times the alarm rang during the day is 22."
"First, we need to calculate the increase in Sylvie's salary due to the policy. This is done by finding 10% of her current monthly salary:

10% of $600 = (10/100) * $600 = $60

So, her salary increases by $60 per year. Since this increase happens annually for the next three years, we will add up these amounts:

$60 * 3 = $180

Now, we'll add this amount to her current monthly salary to find out her new annual salary after three more years of service:

$600 (current monthly salary) + $180 (increase over the next three years) = $780

Therefore, Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service would be $780."
"Let \( H \) represent the number of copies Harald sold.

According to the problem, Marilyn's record sold 10 times as many copies as Harald's, which gives us:

\[ M = 10H \]

We also know that together they sold 88,000 copies, so we can write:

\[ M + H = 88,000 \]

Substitute \( M \) from the first equation into the second equation:

\[ 10H + H = 88,000 \]

Combine like terms:

\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

Now divide both sides by 11 to solve for \( H \):

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies."
"First, we need to calculate the number of guests who actually show up to the party. Since 1/4 of the invited guests don't show up, 3/4 of them will attend:

Number of guests attending = Total guests invited × (3/4)
Number of guests attending = 16 × (3/4)
Number of guests attending = 12

Now, since Christina needs.75 gift bags per guest, we multiply this by the number of guests attending:

Gift bags needed = Number of guests attending ×.75
Gift bags needed = 12 ×.75
Gift bags needed = 9

Since each gift bag costs $2, we multiply the number of gift bags needed by their price to find out the total cost:

Total cost = Gift bags needed × Price per gift bag
Total cost = 9 × $2
Total cost = $18

Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags."
"To calculate the total amount of potato salad needed, we first need to determine the amount of potato salad one adult dinosaur will consume:

10 lbs (adult dinosaur)

Since a child eats half as much as an adult, we divide this amount by 2:

(10 lbs / 2) = 5 lbs (child dinosaur)

Now, let's calculate the total amount of potato salad needed for all the dinosaurs:

For the 20 adults: 
20 adults x 10 lbs/adult = 200 lbs

For the 5 children:
5 children x 5 lbs/child = 25 lbs

Finally, we add the amounts together to get the total:

200 lbs (adults) + 25 lbs (children) = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the dinosaur picnic."
"If Cindy has 4 pets, then Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy. 

Since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, Jan has 6 x 3 = 18 pets.

In total, they all have 4 (Cindy's pets) + 6 (Marcia's pets) + 18 (Jan's pets) = 28 pets."
"Let's denote the ages of Emily's children as follows:

- Amy's age: \( A \)
- Jackson's age: \( J \)
- Corey's age: \( C \)
- James' age: \( I \)

We know the following information:

1. \( I = 10 \)
2. \( I = C - 1 \)
3. \( J = A - 2 \)
4. \( A = J + 5 \)
5. \( A = C - 2 \)

First, we'll use the given information about James and Corey to find their ages:

From \( I = C - 1 \) and \( I = 10 \), we get:
\[ 10 = C - 1 \]
Adding 1 to both sides gives us:
\[ C = 11 \]

Now that we have Corey's age, we can substitute it into the other equations:

Using \( I = C - 1 \):
\[ 10 = 11 - 1 \] (This confirms our value for \( C \)).

Next, using \( A = C - 2 \):
\[ A = 11 - 2 \]
\[ A = 9 \]

With \( A \) known, we can find \( J \) using \( A = J + 5 \):
\[ 9 = J + 5 \]
Subtracting 5 from both sides gives us:
\[ J = 4 \]

Therefore, Jackson is 4 years old."
"To find out how fast Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles with his improved diet, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Lee's original time:** 
   Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald could. Given that Lee runs it in 38 seconds, we first calculate how long it took Gerald to complete the race before the change in diet.

   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = \frac{\text{Lee's time}}{1 - \text{(percentage improvement)}} = \frac{38}{1 - 0.10}
   \]

   Simplifying this,

   \[
   \text{Gerald's original time} = \frac{38}{0.90} = 42.22\ \text{seconds}
   \]

2. **Calculate Gerald's new time with improved diet:**
   
   With a 10% improvement in speed, Gerald's new time will be reduced accordingly.

   \[
   \text{New time} = \text{Original time} \times (1 - \text{(percentage improvement)})
   \]

   Plugging in the values,

   \[
   \text{New time} = 42.22 \times (1 - 0.10) = 42.22 \times 0.90 = 38.00\ \text{seconds}
   \]

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 38 seconds."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The number of rabbits is twelve less than the combined number of pet dogs and cats.
2. The number of dogs is 60.
3. There are two cats for every dog.

First, let's calculate the number of cats based on the ratio given:

Number of cats = Number of dogs × Ratio (2 cats per dog)
Number of cats = 60 × 2
Number of cats = 120

Now we know there are 60 dogs and 120 cats.

Next, let's find out the combined number of pet dogs and cats:

Combined number of dogs and cats = Number of dogs + Number of cats
Combined number of dogs and cats = 60 + 120
Combined number of dogs and cats = 180

According to the first piece of information, the number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined number:

Number of rabbits = Combined number of dogs and cats - 12
Number of rabbits = 180 - 12
Number of rabbits = 168

Finally, let's add up all the pets in the neighborhood:

Total number of pets = Number of dogs + Number of cats + Number of rabbits
Total number of pets = 60 + 120 + 168
Total number of pets = 348

So, there are 348 pets in total in the neighborhood."
"To find out how many girls are not in Girl Scout, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of boys in the class.
2. Determine the number of girls based on the total number of students.
3. Find out how many of those girls are involved in Girl Scout activities.
4. Subtract this number from the total number of girls to get the number of girls who are not in Girl Scout.

Let's go through each step:

1. The number of boys in the class is \( \frac{2}{5} \times 200 = 80 \).
2. Therefore, the number of girls in the class is \( 200 - 80 = 120 \).

Now, let's calculate the number of girls who are in Girl Scout:

3. The fraction of girls who participate in Girl Scout is \( \frac{2}{3} \). This means \( \frac{2}{3} \times 120 = 80 \) girls are in Girl Scout.

Finally, subtracting the number of girls in Girl Scout from the total number of girls gives us the number of girls not in Girl Scout:

4. Girls not in Girl Scout = Total girls - Girls in Girl Scout
\( = 120 - 80 \)
\( = 40 \)

So, there are 40 girls not in Girl Scout."
"To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate how many hours James slept.
   James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \) of what Harry slept, which is \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \).

2. Perform the multiplication.
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \)

So, James slept 6 hours.

3. Find the difference between the number of hours Harry and James slept.
   Harry slept 9 hours, and James slept 6 hours.
   \( 9 - 6 = 3 \)

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To determine how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the initial volume of tomatoes before cooking:**  
   The final volume of the sauce is 32 ounces. Since the tomatoes shrink by half during cooking, the original volume was twice this amount. Therefore,
   \[
   \text{Original volume} = 2 \times 32 \text{ ounces} = 64 \text{ ounces}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of tomatoes needed initially:**  
   Each can of tomatoes contains 3 whole tomatoes. Since 64 ounces corresponds to a full can (assuming the can holds exactly 16 ounces), the number of tomatoes required is:
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes per can} = 3 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]
   Thus, for 64 ounces, Freda needs:
   \[
   \text{Tomatoes needed} = 64 \text{ ounces} \div 16 \text{ ounces/can} \times 3 \text{ tomatoes/can} = 4 \times 3 = 12 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

3. **Consider the additional tomatoes arriving later:**  
   Freda's last batch included an extra 2 cans of tomatoes. Hence, the total number of tomatoes used is:
   \[
   \text{Total tomatoes} = 12 \text{ tomatoes} + 2 \times 3 \text{ tomatoes} = 12 + 6 = 18 \text{ tomatoes}
   \]

Therefore, Freda used a total of **18 tomatoes**."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.
2. In the first 15 minutes, 20 more cars join the line.
   Therefore, the number of cars after the additional arrivals would be:
   \( 30 \text{ (initial cars)} + 20 \text{ (additional cars)} = 50 \text{ cars} \).

3. Out of these 50 cars, 5 cars took an exit, meaning that only 45 cars remained in the traffic jam.

Now we need to determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes:

4. Since initially there were 50 cars and 45 cars remained after some drove through, the difference between the initial count and the final count represents those that drove through:
   \( 50 \text{ (initial cars)} - 45 \text{ (final cars)} = 5 \text{ cars} \).

So, 5 cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes."
"First, we need to determine how many potted plants Mary currently has:

- She has 2 potted plants per window ledge.
- There are 40 window ledges.

So, the number of potted plants she already has is:
\[ 2 \text{ plants/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 80 \text{ plants} \]

Next, we add the newly received potted plants to this count:
\[ 80 \text{ plants (current)} + 18 \text{ plants (received)} = 98 \text{ plants} \]

Mary plans to give away 1 potted plant from each window ledge. Since there are 40 window ledges, she will give away a total of:
\[ 1 \text{ plant/ledge} \times 40 \text{ ledges} = 40 \text{ plants} \]

Finally, we subtract the number of plants given away from the current total to find out how many plants Mary will remain with:
\[ 98 \text{ plants} - 40 \text{ plants (given away)} = 58 \text{ plants} \]

Thus, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"First, we need to calculate the number of times the second friend pressed on the doorbell. Since it was 1/4 more than Jerome's first friend:

Second friend's presses = First friend's presses + (1/4 * First friend's presses)
= 20 + (1/4 * 20)
= 20 + 5
= 25

Next, we know the third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend:

Third friend's presses = Fourth friend's presses + 10
= 60 + 10
= 70

Finally, we add up all the presses made by each person to find the total:

Total presses = First friend's presses + Second friend's presses + Third friend's presses + Fourth friend's presses
= 20 + 25 + 70 + 60
= 175

So, the doorbell made a total of 175 doorbell rings."
"To find out how many pages Solo needs to read on average per day over the remaining four days, we first need to calculate the total number of pages he still needs to read:

Total pages needed = Pages from Science textbook + Pages from Social Studies textbook + Pages from History textbook + Pages from Geography textbook

Total pages needed = 4 (Science) + 20 (Social Studies) + 7 (History) + 8 (Geography)

Total pages needed = 4 + 20 + 7 + 8

Total pages needed = 39

Now, since Solo has 4 more days to finish his reading and 15 pages are already done on Monday, we subtract those pages from the total pages needed:

Pages to be read by the end of the next three days = Total pages needed - Pages already read

Pages to be read by the end of the next three days = 39 - 15

Pages to be read by the end of the next three days = 24

Finally, we divide the number of pages to be read by the number of days to find out how many pages he needs to read on average each day:

Average pages to be read per day = Pages to be read by the end of the next three days / Number of days

Average pages to be read per day = 24 / 3

Average pages to be read per day = 8

So, Solo needs to read an average of 8 pages per day over the next four days to finish his reading."
"Let's break down John's daily routine:

1. Breakfast (one glass of water)
2. Lunch (one glass of water)
3. Dinner (two glasses of water)

So for weekdays (Monday through Friday), John drinks:
Breakfast + Lunch + Two dinners = 1 + 1 + 2 = 4 glasses

Now let's calculate for the weekend:

1. Breakfast (one glass of water)
2. Lunch (one glass of water)
3. Dinner (One glass of water instead of two because it's on the weekend)

So for the weekend, John drinks:
Breakfast + Lunch + One dinner = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3 glasses

To find out how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, we add the totals together:

Weekday glasses + Weekend glasses = 4 + 3 = 7 glasses

Therefore, John drinks 7 glasses of water in a week."
"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we need to calculate the time it takes to cover the distance covered by the fog bank per minute multiplied by the total number of miles.

Firstly, we know that the fog covers 3 miles in 10 minutes. 

Next, we'll use this information to determine how long it would take to cover the entire 42-mile city:

Total time taken = (Distance covered per minute) × (Total distance)

Substituting the values we have:

Total time taken = (3 miles/10 minutes) × (42 miles)

Now let's perform the multiplication:

Total time taken = 3 × 42 / 10

Total time taken = 126 / 10

Total time taken = 12.6 minutes

Therefore, it will take approximately 12.6 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"To determine how many jigsaw pieces Poppy is left with to place, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of pieces Poppy initially places on the board:
   \[
   \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

2. Determine how many pieces remain after Poppy's placement:
   \[
   1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. Calculate the number of pieces placed by Poppy's mom:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]

4. Find out how many pieces are left after her mom's placement:
   \[
   750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, Poppy is left with 500 pieces to place."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, then Cody eats 3 times as many, which means Cody eats 5 x 3 = 15 cookies.

Together, they eat 5 (Amir's cookies) + 15 (Cody's cookies) = 20 cookies.

So, Cody and Amir eat a total of 20 cookies together."
"To find the total inner volume of John's three boxes, we first need to calculate the inner dimensions of one box and then multiply by the number of boxes.

1. **Calculate the inner dimensions of one box**:

   Each box is 5 inches wide, 6 inches long, and 4 inches tall. Since there is a wall thickness of 1 inch on each side, we subtract this thickness from each dimension to get the inner dimensions.

   - Inner width: \( 5 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 5 - 2 = 3 \text{ inches} \)
   - Inner length: \( 6 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 6 - 2 = 4 \text{ inches} \)
   - Inner height: \( 4 \text{ inches} - 2 \times 1 \text{ inch} = 4 - 2 = 2 \text{ inches} \)

2. **Calculate the volume of one box**:

   The volume \( V \) of a rectangular prism (which is what each box is) is given by the formula:

   \[
   V = \text{width} \times \text{length} \times \text{height}
   \]

   Substituting the inner dimensions:

   \[
   V_{\text{one box}} = 3 \text{ inches} \times 4 \text{ inches} \times 2 \text{ inches} = 24 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total inner volume for three boxes**:

   Since there are three boxes, we multiply the volume of one box by 3:

   \[
   V_{\text{total}} = 3 \times V_{\text{one box}} = 3 \times 24 \text{ cubic inches} = 72 \text{ cubic inches}
   \]

Therefore, the total inner volume of all three boxes is 72 cubic inches."
"Let's break down Frankie's viewing schedule:

- Monday and Tuesday: 1 hour each night → Total: \(1 \text{ hour} + 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)
- Wednesday: Few episodes (let's call this number x), which we'll figure out later.
- Thursday: 1 hour episode + 30 minutes (which equals 1.5 hours) → Total: \(1.5 \text{ hours}\)
- Friday: Two 1-hour episodes → Total: \(2 \times 1 \text{ hour} = 2 \text{ hours}\)

Now, let's add these together to find out the total time spent watching TV over those four nights:
\[2 \text{ hours} + x \text{ hours} + 1.5 \text{ hours} + 2 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

Combining like terms gives us:
\[x + 5.5 \text{ hours} = 7 \text{ hours}\]

To solve for \(x\):
\[x = 7 \text{ hours} - 5.5 \text{ hours}\]
\[x = 1.5 \text{ hours}\]

Since 1.5 hours is equivalent to 30 minutes, Frankie watched 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.

Therefore, Frankie watched 30-minute episodes on Wednesday."
"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year as \( x \). According to the problem, he made twice as many this time, which would be \( 2x \).

However, when he dropped 5 cookies, the actual number of cookies he had was \( 2x - 5 \), and we know this equals 110:

\[ 2x - 5 = 110 \]

Now, let's solve for \( x \):

\[
2x - 5 = 110 \\
2x = 115 \\
x = 57.5
\]

So, Henry intended to bake 57.5 cookies last year. Since it's not possible to bake half a cookie, there must be an error in our interpretation or calculations. Let's recheck our steps.

We've assumed that Henry baked exactly 57.5 cookies last year, but since you cannot bake half a cookie, we need to consider if any rounding occurred during the calculation process.

Since the final count (after dropping 5 cookies) is 110, we can infer that Henry probably rounded up the intended amount because baking exactly 57.5 cookies isn't practical. Thus, the correct interpretation is that Henry planned on baking 58 cookies last year (since 57.5 rounds up to 58).

So, the number of cookies Henry baked last year was 58."
"To calculate the final price of the gas after the cashback rewards, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the cashback amount**: 
   The cashback rate is $.20 per gallon. Since the person bought 10 gallons, the cashback amount would be:
   \[
   \text{Cashback} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00
   \]

2. **Subtract the cashback from the original price**:
   The original price per gallon was $3.00. With $2.00 back, the effective price becomes:
   \[
   \text{Effective Price} = \$3.00 - \$2.00 = \$1.00/\text{gallon}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost for 10 gallons at the reduced price**:
   Multiply the effective price per gallon by the number of gallons:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$1.00/\text{gallon} = \$10.00
   \]

Therefore, the final cost for buying 10 gallons of gas, including the cashback, would be $10.00."
"To calculate the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to first determine the total number of roll-ups each person consumed and then divide that by 2 (since there are two people).

For Beatrice, the area covered by her roll-ups would be:

\[ \text{Area}_\text{Beatrice} = (\text{Width}_\text{Beatrice}) \times (\text{Length}_\text{Beatrice}) \]
\[ \text{Area}_\text{Beatrice} = 2 \times 24 \]

For Marcell, the area covered by his roll-ups would be:

\[ \text{Area}_\text{Marcell} = (\text{Width}_\text{Marcell}) \times (\text{Length}_\text{Marcell}) \]
\[ \text{Area}_\text{Marcell} = 3 \times 14 \]

Now, let's calculate these areas:

\[ \text{Area}_\text{Beatrice} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]
\[ \text{Area}_\text{Marcell} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Next, we add these two areas together to get the total area covered by all the roll-ups:

\[ \text{Total Area} = \text{Area}_\text{Beatrice} + \text{Area}_\text{Marcell} \]
\[ \text{Total Area} = 48 + 42 = 90 \]

Finally, to find the average number of roll-ups eaten per person, we divide the total area by 2:

\[ \text{Average} = \frac{\text{Total Area}}{2} \]
\[ \text{Average} = \frac{90}{2} = 45 \]

So, on average, they ate 45 roll-ups each."
"To find out how much water the boat had taken on, we first need to determine how long it took to reach the shore. 

We know that it takes 16 seconds to row 20 feet. Therefore, it would take:

\( \frac{16\text{ seconds}}{20\text{ feet}} \times 64\text{ feet} = 4.8\text{ minutes} \)

Now, since the boat leaks at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet, we can calculate the amount of water leaking over this distance:

\( \frac{2\text{ liters}}{10\text{ feet}} \times 48\text{ feet} = 9.6\text{ liters} \)

So, by the time Julia reaches the shore, the boat has leaked approximately 9.6 liters of water."
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider both the number of teachers and the frequency of cleaning per teacher's lesson.

1. **Number of Teachers**: There are 4 teachers taking turns using the classroom daily.

2. **Cleaning Frequency per Teacher's Lesson**: Each teacher has 2 lessons per day and cleans the whiteboard 3 times per lesson.

Let's calculate the total number of cleanings per teacher:

\[ \text{Cleanings per teacher} = \text{Number of lessons per teacher} \times \text{Cleaning frequency per lesson} \]
\[ \text{Cleanings per teacher} = 2 \times 3 \]

Now, let's multiply these values together:

\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = \text{Number of teachers} \times \text{Cleanings per teacher} \]
\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 4 \times (2 \times 3) \]

First, simplify within the parentheses:

\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 4 \times 6 \]

Finally, perform the multiplication:

\[ \text{Total cleanings per day} = 24 \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times in a day."
"To find out how many flowers Ryan has, we first need to calculate the total number of flowers he planted over the 15 days. Since he plants 2 flowers per day, the total number of flowers planted would be:

\( 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \)

Now, since 5 flowers didn't grow, we subtract those from the total number of flowers planted:

\( 30 \text{ flowers} - 5 \text{ flowers} = 25 \text{ flowers} \)

So, after 15 days, Ryan has 25 flowers that grew."
"First, we need to find out how many photographs Jamal's phone can hold compared to Brittany's phone. Since Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, we divide the number of photographs on Jamal's phone by 6:

\( \frac{1800}{6} = 300 \)

This means Brittany's phone can hold 300 photographs.

Next, we know that Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. Let's call the number of birds in Jamal's photograph ""x"". Therefore, we have:

\( 300 = 50x \)

To find x (the number of birds), we divide both sides of the equation by 50:

\( x = \frac{300}{50} \)

\( x = 6 \)

So, Jamal's photograph shows 6 ducks.

Therefore, Jamal's photograph of ducks at the zoo contains 6 ducks."
"To calculate Sasha's profit, we need to determine both her initial investment and the selling price of the lumber.

Firstly, let's calculate the initial investment:

For the ten 2x4x10 boards costing $10 each:
\( 10 \times $10 = $100 \)

For the five 4x4x10 boards costing $16 each:
\( 5 \times $16 = $80 \)

Total initial investment:
\( $100 + $80 = $180 \)

Next, we'll calculate the selling price for all the lumber:

For the ten 2x4x10 boards sold at full price:
\( 10 \times $10 = $100 \)

For the five 4x4x10 boards sold at full price:
\( 5 \times $16 = $80 \)

Total selling price:
\( $100 + $80 = $180 \)

Finally, we subtract the initial investment from the total selling price to find the profit:

Profit = Total Selling Price - Initial Investment

\( Profit = $180 - $180 = $0 \)

So, Sasha makes a profit of $0 by selling all the lumber."
"To solve this problem, we need to understand the given ratio and use it to find out how much sugar (teaspoons) Katy used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, there are 13 cups of water. 

Let's denote the amount of sugar used by \( x \) teaspoons. According to the ratio:

\[ \frac{x}{13} = \frac{7}{13} \]

From this proportion, we can see that \( x = 7 \). Therefore, Katy used 7 teaspoons of sugar."
"To calculate how much John paid for the shoes:

1 pair of shoes costs $60
He bought 2 pairs per child, and he has 3 children

So, the calculation would be:

\( 2 \text{ pairs/child} \times 3 \text{ children} \times \$60/\text{pair} \)

\( = 6 \times \$60 \)

\( = \$360 \)

Therefore, John paid a total of $360 for the shoes."
"To find out how many containers were imported on the second day, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of vehicles initially:**
   - There are 2 containers of imported vehicles.
   - Each container contains 5 vehicles.
   \[
   2 \text{ containers} \times 5 \text{ vehicles per container} = 10 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

2. **Determine the total number of vehicles after the importation:**
   - According to the problem, after importing additional vehicles, the total becomes 30 vehicles.

3. **Find out how many new vehicles were imported:**
   \[
   30 \text{ vehicles (total)} - 10 \text{ vehicles (initially)} = 20 \text{ vehicles}
   \]

4. **Calculate the number of containers needed to bring in 20 new vehicles:**
   - Each container holds 5 vehicles.
   \[
   \frac{20 \text{ vehicles}}{5 \text{ vehicles per container}} = 4 \text{ containers}
   \]

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"To solve this problem, let's first determine the initial salaries of both Adrien and Lylah:

1. Let \( A_0 \) represent Adrien's initial salary, which we know is $40,000.
2. Let \( L_0 \) represent Lylah's initial salary.

From the information given, we know that Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's:

\[ A_0 = 1.3L_0 \]

Given that \( A_0 = \$40,000 \), we can find Lylah's initial salary as follows:

\[ L_0 = \frac{A_0}{1.3} \]
\[ L_0 = \frac{\$40,000}{1.3} \]
\[ L_0 \approx \$30,769.23 \]

Next, we need to consider their salaries four years later when both experienced a simultaneous increase of 40%.

Let \( A_{\text{new}} \) and \( L_{\text{new}} \) represent Adrien and Lylah's new salaries after the increases.

For Adrien, his salary will increase by 40%, so his new salary would be:

\[ A_{\text{new}} = A_0 + 0.4A_0 \]
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 1.4A_0 \]
\[ A_{\text{new}} = 1.4(\$40,000) \]
\[ A_{\text{new}} = \$56,000 \]

Similarly, for Lylah, her salary will also increase by 40%, thus:

\[ L_{\text{new}} = L_0 + 0.4L_0 \]
\[ L_{\text{new}} = 1.4L_0 \]
\[ L_{\text{new}} = 1.4(\$30,769.23) \]
\[ L_{\text{new}} \approx \$43,075.90 \]

Now, add their new salaries together to get the total:

\[ Total\_Salary_{\text{new}} = A_{\text{new}} + L_{\text{new}} \]
\[ Total\_Salary_{\text{new}} = \$56,0"
"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sheets used per week:** 
   Miguel uses 2 pads of paper a week. Since there are 30 sheets in one pad, the total number of sheets used per week is:
   \[
   2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
   \]

2. **Convert weeks into months (assuming 4 weeks per month):**
   Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month, the monthly usage would be:
   \[
   60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month} = 240 \text{ sheets/month}
   \]

So, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."
"To find out how many fruits Morisette and Kael brought in total, let's first calculate the number of fruits each person brought:

**For Morisette:**
- Apples: 5
- Oranges: 8

Total fruits Morisette brought = 5 (apples) + 8 (oranges) = **13 fruits**

**For Kael:**
- Since Kael brought twice as many apples as Morisette, Kael brought 2 * 5 = **10 apples**.
- And since Kael brought half the number of oranges compared to Morisette, Kael brought 8 / 2 = **4 oranges**.

Total fruits Kael brought = 10 (apples) + 4 (oranges) = **14 fruits**

Now we add up all the fruits they both brought together:

Morisette's fruits + Kael's fruits = Total fruits
= 13 (Morisette's fruits) + 14 (Kael's fruits)
= **27 fruits**

So, Morisette and Kael brought a total of 27 fruits."
"First, we need to calculate how much Sadie slept during the first two days when she had to complete assignments. Since she slept 2 hours less each day compared to the previous day (because she had to complete some assignments), we can determine the number of hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday:

- Monday: 8 hours
- Tuesday: 8 - 2 = 6 hours
- Wednesday: 6 - 2 = 4 hours

Now, let's add up the hours she slept over these three days:

- Total for Monday: 8 hours
- Total for Tuesday: 6 hours
- Total for Wednesday: 4 hours

Total for the first four days: 8 + 6 + 4 = 18 hours

Next, we know that the rest of the week she slept 1 hour more than those two days combined. The total amount she slept on those two days was 18 hours, so for the remaining days of the week, she would have slept:

18 + 1 = 19 hours

Finally, we add this amount to the 18 hours she slept in the first four days to find out the total amount she slept throughout the entire week:

18 (first four days) + 19 (remaining days) = 37 hours

So, Sadie slept a total of 37 hours throughout the week."
"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into segments based on her speed changes.

1. **First Segment (Initial Speed):**
   - Speed: 10 miles per hour
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Distance covered in this segment: \(10 \text{ mph} \times 3 \text{ hours} = 30 \text{ miles}\)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - Speed: 5 miles per hour
   - Since the question specifies a total time of 7 hours and she has already run 30 miles, we assume she stops here because the problem doesn't mention any additional time or distance beyond these two segments.
   
Now let's calculate the total distance:

Total distance = Distance in first segment + Distance in second segment

\[ \text{Total distance} = 30 \text{ miles} + 0 \text{ miles} = 30 \text{ miles} \]

So, Rosie can run a total of 30 miles in 7 hours."
"To determine how many letters were initially in the pile of already-stamped letters, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of letters needing stamps after Jennie adds stamps:**
   Since Jennie put stamps on one-third of the letters needing stamps, let \( x \) represent the initial number of letters needing stamps before adding any stamps. According to the problem, one-third of these letters received stamps, resulting in:
   \[
   \frac{x}{3}
   \]

2. **Determine the relationship between the number of already-stamped letters and the remaining letters needing stamps:**
   After stamping, the number of already-stamped letters became 30. This implies that the number of letters needing stamps minus those already stamped equals 30:
   \[
   x - \frac{x}{3} = 30
   \]

3. **Solve the equation for \( x \):**
   To solve this equation, first find a common denominator for the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{3x}{3} - \frac{x}{3} = 30
   \]
   Simplify by combining the fractions:
   \[
   \frac{2x}{3} = 30
   \]
   Multiply both sides by 3 to isolate \( 2x \):
   \[
   2x = 90
   \]
   Divide both sides by 2 to solve for \( x \):
   \[
   x = 45
   \]

Thus, there were initially 45 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters when Jennie began."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Julia had no spoons because she was out of them.
2. Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to her.
   Now, Julia has 5 + 0 = 5 spoons.
3. Julia then used 3 spoons to sample her stew.
   Now, Julia has 5 - 3 = 2 spoons left.
4. We know that later, when setting the table, Julia had a total of 12 spoons.
   
So, we need to find out how many spoons were in the package that Julia bought initially. Let's denote this number as x.

According to the information given:
x (initially bought) + 5 (bought by husband) - 3 (used for sampling) = 12 (total spoons)

Now, let's solve for x:
x + 5 - 3 = 12
x + 2 = 12
x = 12 - 2
x = 10

Therefore, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons."
"To determine the total number of sausages Dylan bought, we need to calculate the quantity of fish sausages first since it's given that he bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages.

Given that Dylan bought 38 chicken sausages, the number of fish sausages he bought would be:

\[ \text{Number of fish sausages} = \text{Number of chicken sausages} + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of fish sausages} = 38 + 6 \]
\[ \text{Number of fish sausages} = 44 \]

Now, let's add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together to find the total number of sausages:

\[ \text{Total number of sausages} = \text{Number of chicken sausages} + \text{Number of fish sausages} \]
\[ \text{Total number of sausages} = 38 + 44 \]
\[ \text{Total number of sausages} = 82 \]

So, Dylan bought a total of 82 sausages."
"To find out how many friends Lily and Amy have together, we need to first determine how many friends Amy made. We know that Amy made 20 more friends than Lily, who made 50 friends. Therefore:

Amy's number of friends = Lily's number of friends + 20

Substitute Lily's number of friends into the equation:

Amy's number of friends = 50 + 20
Amy's number of friends = 70

Now we add the number of friends Lily has to the number of friends Amy has:

Total number of friends = Lily's friends + Amy's friends
Total number of friends = 50 + 70
Total number of friends = 120

So, Lily and Amy have a total of 120 friends together."
"To find out the total amount of money Dillon will spend, we need to first determine the price of each item based on the given information:

1. Pepper cost: $15

Since a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper, we calculate the price of a watermelon as follows:

Watermelon cost = 3 × Pepper cost
Watermelon cost = 3 × $15
Watermelon cost = $45

Next, an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon, so we calculate the price of an orange as follows:

Orange cost = Watermelon cost - $5
Orange cost = $45 - $5
Orange cost = $40

Now that we know the prices of all items, let's calculate the total amount Dillon will spend by multiplying the number of each type of fruit by its respective price:

Total spending = (Number of watermelons × Watermelon cost) +
                (Number of peppers × Pepper cost) +
                (Number of oranges × Orange cost)

Substituting the values:

Total spending = (4 × $45) +
               (20 × $15) +
               (10 × $40)

Calculating these:

Total spending = ($180) +
               ($300) +
               ($400)

Adding them together:

Total spending = $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Therefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880."
"To calculate the hospital's profit, we need to first determine the revenue generated from all the patients' visits and then subtract the costs associated with providing those services.

First, let's find out how many hours it takes to see all the patients:

Number of patients per day = 500
Time per patient (in hours) = 24 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 0.4 hours

Total time spent seeing patients = Number of patients × Time per patient
Total time spent seeing patients = 500 × 0.4 = 200 hours

Now, let's calculate the revenue from these visits:

Revenue per visit = Charge by doctor ($150/hour) × Hours spent on each visit (0.4)
Revenue per visit = $150 × 0.4 = $60

Total revenue = Revenue per visit × Total number of visits
Total revenue = $60 × 500 = $30,000

Next, let's calculate the costs associated with these visits:

Cost per visit = Charge by hospital ($200/hour) × Hours spent on each visit (0.4)
Cost per visit = $200 × 0.4 = $80

Total cost = Cost per visit × Total number of visits
Total cost = $80 × 500 = $40,000

Finally, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = Total revenue - Total cost
Profit = $30,000 - $40,000 = -$10,000

So, the hospital actually loses $10,000 from these visits. This could indicate inefficiencies or issues within the hospital's operations that need addressing."
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. Nissa initially hires 60 elves.

2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. 
   To find a third of 60, we divide 60 by 3:
   \[
   \frac{60}{3} = 20
   \]
   So, 20 elves quit because of vomiting.

3. Subtracting those who quit due to vomiting from the initial number gives us:
   \[
   60 - 20 = 40
   \]

4. Next, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins.
   We subtract these 10 from the current number of elves:
   \[
   40 - 10 = 30
   \]

Therefore, there are 30 elves left in the Santa Village."
"To find out Joseph's total expenditure for May and June, we need to calculate the expenditure for each month separately and then add them together.

For May, the expenditure was $500.

For June, the expenditure was $60 less than what it was in May. So, we subtract $60 from $500:

$500 - $60 = $440

Now, we add the expenditures for both months to get the total:

May: $500
June: $440

Total expenditure = $500 (May) + $440 (June)
Total expenditure = $940

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"To find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used at the carnival, we need to calculate the number of rides each person took and then multiply by the ticket price per ride.

First, let's calculate the number of rides each person took:

For Pam:
She rode the roller coaster 2 times and then the luge 2 times.
So, Pam took a total of 2 + 2 = 4 rides.

For Fred:
He also rode the roller coaster 4 times (same as Pam), and then the luge 2 times.
So, Fred took a total of 4 + 2 = 6 rides.

Now, let's calculate the total number of tickets used:

Each ride costs 6 tickets.
Pam used 4 rides x 6 tickets/ride = 24 tickets.
Fred used 6 rides x 6 tickets/ride = 36 tickets.

Therefore, Pam and Fred used a total of 24 + 36 = 60 tickets that day."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to first determine the distance he walked on Tuesday and then use that information along with the total distance over the three days to calculate the distance he walked on Wednesday.

Step 1: Calculate the distance Walt walked on Tuesday.
Walt walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday. Since he walked 4 miles on Monday, the calculation would be:

Distance on Tuesday = 6 × Distance on Monday
Distance on Tuesday = 6 × 4
Distance on Tuesday = 24 miles

Step 2: Calculate the total distance walked by the end of Tuesday.
Total distance by the end of Tuesday = Distance on Monday + Distance on Tuesday
Total distance by the end of Tuesday = 4 + 24
Total distance by the end of Tuesday = 28 miles

Step 3: Determine the distance Walt walked on Wednesday.
We know that the total distance by the end of Wednesday was 41 miles. To find out how far he walked on Wednesday, we subtract the total distance by the end of Tuesday from this number:

Distance on Wednesday = Total distance by the end of Wednesday - Total distance by the end of Tuesday
Distance on Wednesday = 41 - 28
Distance on Wednesday = 13 miles

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, you need to multiply the number of car washes per month by the cost per car wash and then by the number of months in a year.

So,

Number of car washes per month: 4

Cost per car wash: $15

Months in a year: 12

Total amount paid in a year:

\( (4 \text{ car washes/month}) \times (\$15/\text{car wash}) \times (12 \text{ months/year}) \)

\( = 4 \times 15 \times 12 \)

\( = 60 \times 12 \)

\( = \$720 \)

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we need to determine how many video games Brian actually has after losing 5 of them. Since Brian initially had 20 video games, we subtract the 5 he lost:
   \[ 20 - 5 = 15 \]
   So, Brian currently has 15 video games.

2. Next, we calculate how many video games Bobby has based on the information given. The statement says that Bobby has ""5 fewer than 3 times as many video games"" as Brian. To find out how many Bobby has, we first multiply the number of Brian's video games (15) by 3:
   \[ 3 \times 15 = 45 \]

3. Finally, since Bobby has 5 fewer video games than this amount, we subtract 5 from 45:
   \[ 45 - 5 = 40 \]

Therefore, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we need to follow these steps:

1. First, determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands by calculating one-third of the total number of unicorns.
2. Next, calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns by finding two-thirds of the unicorns in the Scottish Highlands.

Let's start with step 1:

Total unicorns = 27

Unicorns in the Scottish Highlands = (1/3) * Total unicorns
= (1/3) * 27
= 9 unicorns

Now, let's move on to step 2:

Female Scottish unicorns = (2/3) * Unicorns in the Scottish Highlands
= (2/3) * 9
= 6 unicorns

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns."
"To calculate Rory's total delivery order cost, we need to first determine the subtotal before any discounts or additional charges. We'll start by calculating the cost of each item:

Subs: 
2 x $7.50 = $15.00

Chips:
2 x $1.50 = $3.00

Cookies:
2 x $1.00 = $2.00

Now, let's sum these up to get the subtotal:
$15.00 (subs) + $3.00 (chips) + $2.00 (cookies) = $20.00

Next, we'll apply the 20% delivery fee:
Delivery fee = 20% of $20.00 = 0.20 x $20.00 = $4.00

Finally, we'll add the tip to the subtotal:
Total cost = Subtotal + Delivery fee + Tip
Total cost = $20.00 + $4.00 + $5.00 = $29.00

Therefore, Rory's delivery order cost will be $29.00."
"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate how many questions he could complete in the time given for each test and then subtract this number from the total number of questions in each test.

For the first test:

Time available: 8 hours
Rate of completing questions: 5 questions per hour

Total questions completed in the first test = Rate × Time
= 5 questions/hour × 8 hours
= 40 questions

Since there are 75 questions in the test and he completes 40 questions, the number of questions left incomplete in the first test is:

Questions left incomplete = Total questions - Questions completed
= 75 questions - 40 questions
= 35 questions

Now let's calculate for the second test:

Time available: 6 hours
Rate of completing questions: 5 questions per hour

Total questions completed in the second test = Rate × Time
= 5 questions/hour × 6 hours
= 30 questions

Since there are 100 questions in the test and he completes 30 questions, the number of questions left incomplete in the second test is:

Questions left incomplete = Total questions - Questions completed
= 100 questions - 30 questions
= 70 questions

Therefore, Mark left 35 questions incomplete in the first test and 70 questions incomplete in the second test."
"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs as B and the number of pink gumballs as P. According to the problem:

B = 12 (the given number of blue gumballs)

Now we know that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. We can write this as an equation:

P = 4 * B + 22

Substituting the value of B into the equation:

P = 4 * 12 + 22

Calculating the right side of the equation:

P = 48 + 22

Adding these numbers together gives us:

P = 70

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine."
"To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the number of semi-automatic cars.
   Total cars = 20
   Automatic cars = 12
   Manual cars = 4
   
   Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - Automatic cars - Manual cars
                       = 20 - 12 - 4
                       = 4

2. Calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars.
   Percentage = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total cars) × 100%
             = (4 / 20) × 100%
             = 0.2 × 100%
             = 20%

So, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote the number of queens by \( Q \), the number of baby bees by \( B \), and the number of worker bees by \( W \).

According to the problem:

1. The number of baby bees (\(B\)) is half the number of queens (\(Q\)), which gives us the equation:
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}Q \]

2. The number of worker bees (\(W\)) is twice the number of baby bees (\(B\)), giving us another equation:
\[ W = 2B \]

We also know that the total number of bees in the hive is 700, which leads to the third equation:
\[ W + B + Q = 700 \]

Now we can substitute \( B \) and \( W \) using the first two equations into the third one. First, let's express \( B \) and \( W \) in terms of \( Q \):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}Q \]
\[ W = 2B = 2 \left(\frac{1}{2}Q\right) = Q \]

Now substituting these expressions back into the total bee count equation:
\[ Q + \frac{1}{2}Q + Q = 700 \]

Combine like terms:
\[ 2Q + \frac{1}{2}Q = 700 \]

To solve for \( Q \), multiply through by 2 to clear the fraction:
\[ 4Q + Q = 1400 \]
\[ 5Q = 1400 \]
\[ Q = \frac{1400}{5} \]
\[ Q = 280 \]

So, there are 280 queens. 

Next, use this value to find the number of baby bees (\(B\)):
\[ B = \frac{1}{2}Q = \frac{1}{2}(280) = 140 \]

Finally, calculate the number of worker bees (\(W\)):
\[ W = 2B = 2(140) = 280 \]

Therefore, there are 280 worker bees in the hive."
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn if he spent his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of hours Jordan spends playing video games per day:** 
   Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day.

2. **Determine the earnings per hour from his part-time job:**
   Jordan earns $10 per hour from his part-time job.

3. **Calculate the daily earnings from his part-time job:**
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings} = \text{Number of Hours Worked} \times \text{Earnings Per Hour}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Daily Earnings} = 2 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$20/\text{day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the weekly earnings from his part-time job:**
   Assuming a standard workweek consists of 7 days,
   \[
   \text{Weekly Earnings} = \text{Daily Earnings} \times \text{Days in a Week}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Weekly Earnings} = \$20/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$140/\text{week}
   \]

So, if Jordan spends his video game time working instead, he would earn $\boxed{140}$ dollars in one week."
"First, let's calculate the total cost of food:

Milk: $2
Eggs: $3
Light bulbs: $3

Total food cost = $2 + $3 + $3 = $8

Now, let's add up the cost of the non-food items before tax:

Cups: $3
Roach traps: $4

Total non-food cost before tax = $3 + $4 = $7

Next, we need to calculate the tax on the non-food items:

Tax rate = 10%
Tax amount = 10% of $7 = 0.10 * $7 = $0.70

Now, let's include the tax in the total cost:

Total cost including tax = Total food cost + Tax amount
Total cost including tax = $8 + $0.70 = $8.70

So, the total cost of everything (including taxes) is $8.70."
"To calculate Kim's weekly profit, we first need to determine his total expenses. 

Each client needs:

- 2 bottles of bleach (costing $2 each)
- A pack of cloths (costing $5)

So, each client's total expense is:

\( 2 \times \$2 + \$5 = \$4 + \$5 = \$9 \)

He has already talked to 3 clients and plans to talk to 5 more, which makes him have a total of \( 3 + 5 = 8 \) potential clients.

Therefore, his total expenses for these 8 clients would be:

\( 8 \times \$9 = \$72 \)

His total income per week is given as $92.

Now, to find his profit, subtract the total expenses from the total income:

Profit = Total Income - Total Expenses

\( Profit = \$92 - \$72 = \$20 \)

Thus, Kim will make a profit of $20 each week."
"To calculate the number of pineapples John can harvest within a year:

1. First, determine the total number of pineapples in the entire field:
   Total pineapples = Number of hectares × Pineapples per hectare
                     = 10 hectares × 100 pineapples/hectare
                     = 1000 pineapples

2. Since John can harvest pineapples every 3 months, we need to find out how many times this happens in a year (which is 12 months).

3. Calculate the number of harvests in a year:
   Harvests/year = Months in a year / Harvest interval
                = 12 months / 3 months/harvest
                = 4 harvests/year

4. Finally, multiply the number of harvests by the total number of pineapples to get the annual yield:
   Annual yield = Harvests/year × Total pineapples
               = 4 harvests/year × 1000 pineapples
               = 4000 pineapples

So, John can harvest approximately 4000 pineapples within a year."
"To find out how many Lego pieces Johnny picked up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in each box and then sum them up.

First Box:
Number of pieces = 500

Second Box (3 times more):
Number of pieces = 500 x 3 = 1500

Third Box (1/4 the number of pieces):
Number of pieces = 500 / 4 = 125

Now, let's add these numbers together:

Total pieces = First Box + Second Box + Third Box
Total pieces = 500 + 1500 + 125
Total pieces = 2125

So, Johnny picks up 2,125 Lego pieces."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Bee departures**: Initially, 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours.

2. **Returnees (first group)**: The next 6 hours, half as many bees return compared to those who initially left. Since 30 bees left, half of this number would be \( \frac{30}{2} = 15 \) bees returning.

3. **Second departure batch**: Two times as many bees as those who initially left (30) return in the next 6 hours. This is \( 2 \times 30 = 60 \) bees returning.

4. **Returning bees**:
    - These 60 bees are not accounted for yet since we're focusing on the ones that haven't returned yet.
    - We know that out of the 30 bees that initially left, 15 have returned during the first 6 hours. Therefore, \( 30 - 15 = 15 \) bees didn’t return back yet.
    - In the subsequent 6-hour period, these remaining 15 bees return to the hive.

Thus, Debra sees 15 bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day."
"To find out how much money Brittany's mom gave the cashier, we need to calculate the total cost of one child ticket and one adult ticket first, then subtract the change she received to determine what she paid initially.

Cost of a child ticket: $10
Cost of an adult ticket: $12

Total cost of one child ticket and one adult ticket: $10 (child) + $12 (adult) = $22

She received $8 in change, which means she paid $22 - $8 = $14 for the tickets.

Therefore, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $14."
"To find out how many Facebook friends James has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the number of Facebook friends Dorothy has:**  
   Since Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy, and Charlie has 12 friends, we divide by 3:
   \[
   \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{\text{Charlie's friends}}{3} = \frac{12}{3} = 4
   \]

2. **Calculate the number of Facebook friends James has:**  
   James has four times as many friends as Dorothy, so we multiply Dorothy's number of friends by 4:
   \[
   \text{James' friends} = 4 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16
   \]

Therefore, James has 16 Facebook friends."
"To determine who wins the race and how long they will wait, we first need to calculate the time it takes for each person to reach their respective destinations.

Firstly, let's convert the distances from miles to feet since the speeds are given in feet per minute:

- Steve lives 3 miles from the school.
- Tim lives 2 miles from the school.

Since 1 mile equals 5280 feet, we can calculate the distance in feet as follows:

- Distance for Steve: \( 3 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 15840 \text{ feet} \)
- Distance for Tim: \( 2 \text{ miles} \times 5280 \text{ feet/mile} = 10560 \text{ feet} \)

Next, we'll calculate the time it takes for each person to cover these distances by dividing the distance by their respective speeds.

For Steve (biking):
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Steve}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Steve}}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim (skating):
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = \frac{\text{Distance}_{\text{Tim}}}{\text{Speed}_{\text{Tim}}} = \frac{10560 \text{ feet}}{264 \text{ feet/minute}} \]

\[ \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} = 40 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we compare the times to find out who wins and how long the winner waits for the other:

- Steve finishes the race in 36 minutes.
- Tim finishes the race in 40 minutes.

Therefore, Steve wins the race. The difference in their finishing times gives us the amount of time Steve will wait for Tim:

\[ \text{Waiting Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{Tim}} - \text{Time}_{\text{Steve}} \]
\[ \text{Waiting Time} = 40 \text{ minutes} - 36 \text{ minutes} \]

"To calculate Shawnda's earnings, we need to multiply the number of tires inflated per person by the cost per tire, and then add up the amounts for each group.

First group (bicycles): 
5 people × 2 tires/person = 10 tires

Second group (tricycles):
3 people × 2 tires/person = 6 tires

Third group (unicycle):
1 person × 1 tire/person = 1 tire

Now, let's calculate the total earnings:

Cost per tire = $0.25

Total earnings from bicycles:
10 tires × $0.25/tire = $2.50

Total earnings from tricycles:
6 tires × $0.25/tire = $1.50

Total earnings from unicycles:
1 tire × $0.25/tire = $0.25

Finally, let's sum up all the earnings:

$2.50 (bicycles) + $1.50 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) = $4.25

Therefore, Shawnda made $4.25 that day."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of cookies Carl receives:

Total cookies = Number of packs × Cookies per pack
               = 10 packs × 6 cookies/pack
               = 60 cookies

Next, we calculate the total cost of these cookies:

Cost per cookie = $0.10
Total cost = Total cookies × Cost per cookie
           = 60 cookies × $0.10/cookie
           = $6.00

Now, let's find out how much change Carl will get when paying with a $10 bill:

Change = Amount paid - Total cost
       = $10.00 - $6.00
       = $4.00

So, Carl will receive $4.00 in change."
"Let's work backwards from the information given:

1. A seagull gobbled down half the amount of french fries that Dave ate initially (which was 14), meaning the seagull ate 14 / 2 = 7 fries.

2. The seagull also landed on top of the pack while eating, which means the original number of fries was twice what the seagull ate plus the 14 fries Dave ate. So the original number of fries was 7 * 2 + 14 = 28 fries.

3. Three pigeons then came along and ate three fries each, which means they collectively ate 3 * 3 = 9 fries.

4. The raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries, leaving five fries behind. This means that before the raccoon took any, there were 5 * (3/2) = 7.5 fries. Since we can't have half a fry, let's round up to 8 fries because you can't really eat part of a fry.

5. Finally, the ants carried off one last fry, leaving five fries behind. This means there were 5 + 1 = 6 fries before the ants arrived.

So, the original number of fries in the pack when Dave bought it was 8 fries (before the raccoon stole them)."
"To find out how many hours Kimo spends attending class in a semester, we need to calculate the number of hours he spends per week and then multiply by the number of weeks in a semester.

First, let's break down the weekly schedule:

**Monday, Wednesday, Friday:** 
Each day has 3 classes lasting 1 hour each.
Total time spent on these days per week = 3 days * 1 hour/class * 3 classes/day = 9 hours

**Tuesday, Thursday:**
Each day has 2 classes lasting 2 hours each.
Total time spent on these days per week = 2 days * 2 hours/class * 2 classes/day = 8 hours

Now, add the hours from both sets of days to get the total hours spent per week:
Total hours per week = Hours on Monday, Wednesday, Friday + Hours on Tuesday, Thursday
= 9 hours + 8 hours = 17 hours

Next, we'll multiply this weekly average by the number of weeks in a semester:
Hours per semester = Weekly hours * Number of weeks in a semester
= 17 hours/week * 16 weeks = 272 hours

So, in one semester, Kimo spends 272 hours attending classes."
"To find out how long all the baked goods will be in feet when put end-to-end, we need to calculate the length of each type of baked good separately and then add them together.

First, let's convert the lengths into feet:

- Rolls: Since each roll is 4 inches long and there are 12 inches in a foot, one roll is equal to \( \frac{4}{12} \) feet, which simplifies to \( \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
- Croissants: Each croissant is 6 inches long, which converts to \( \frac{6}{12} \) or \( \frac{1}{2} \) foot.
- Baguettes: Each baguette is 2 feet long.

Now we'll calculate the total length for each type of baked good:

- Rolls: With 300 rolls, the total length would be \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} \) feet.
- Croissants: With 120 croissants, the total length would be \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
- Baguettes: With 60 baguettes, the total length would be \( 60 \times 2 \) feet.

Adding these up gives us the total length:

\[ 300 \times \frac{1}{3} + 120 \times \frac{1}{2} + 60 \times 2 \]

Let's simplify this:

\[ 100 + 60 + 120 = 280 \] feet

So, if Bill puts all the baked goods end to end, they will be 280 feet long."
"To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order for the next 2 months, we first calculate the daily banana requirements for each group:

Monkeys: 200 bananas / 30 days = 6.67 bananas per monkey per day

Gorillas: 400 bananas / 30 days = 13.33 bananas per gorilla per day

Baboons: 100 bananas / 30 days = 3.33 bananas per baboon per day

Next, we find out the weekly banana requirement for each group by multiplying their daily banana requirement by 7 (days):

Monkeys: 6.67 bananas/day × 7 days/week = 46.69 bananas per week

Gorillas: 13.33 bananas/day × 7 days/week = 93.31 bananas per week

Baboons: 3.33 bananas/day × 7 days/week = 23.31 bananas per week

Now, we sum up the weekly banana requirements for all groups:

Total weekly banana requirement = 46.69 bananas/monkey/week + 93.31 bananas/gorilla/week + 23.31 bananas/baboon/week
                                   = 163.31 bananas/week

Finally, since the zookeeper orders supplies every 2 months, which equals approximately 8 weeks (2 months x 4 weeks/month), we multiply the total weekly requirement by this number to get the monthly requirement:

Monthly banana requirement = 163.31 bananas/week × 8 weeks/month
                            ≈ 1306.48 bananas/month

Since you cannot purchase a fraction of a banana, the zookeeper would need to round up or down based on practical considerations, but mathematically, the zookeeper needs to order **1306** bananas to cover the demand for the next 2 months."
"To determine how far each person ran, we need to calculate the distance for both Blake and Kelly individually.

Firstly, let's find out how far Blake ran:

1. Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
2. The length of one round trip (back and forth) on a football field is 100 yards / 2 = 50 yards.
3. Therefore, each round trip is 50 yards.
4. Since he makes 15 such trips, the total distance Blake ran is \( 15 \times 50 \) yards.

\[
15 \times 50 = 750 \text{ yards}
\]

Next, let's calculate how far Kelly ran:

1. Kelly first runs back and forth 1 time, which covers 100 yards.
2. Then, she runs to the 40-yard line and back, covering an additional 40 yards.
3. This pattern repeats 34 times.

Since each segment of the race is 100 yards, the total distance Kelly runs per cycle is 100 yards (to the 40-yard line) + 100 yards (back to where she started), which equals 200 yards.

Now, since she completes 34 cycles, we multiply the distance of one cycle by the number of cycles:

\[
200 \times 34 = 6800 \text{ yards}
\]

Finally, to find out how much farther the winner ran compared to the loser, subtract the total distance the loser ran from the total distance the winner ran:

\[
750 \text{ yards} - 6800 \text{ yards} = -6050 \text{ yards}
\]

Thus, the winner (Blake) ran 6050 yards farther than the loser (Kelly).

So, Blake ran 6050 yards farther than Kelly."
"To calculate the total amount Raphael spent, we need to add up all the costs of the items he purchased:

- Pens: 4 pens × $1.5 per pen = $6
- Notebooks: 2 notebooks × $4 per notebook = $8
- Rims of bond paper: $20

Now, let's sum these amounts:

$6 (pens) + $8 (notebooks) + $20 (rim of bond paper) = $34

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on everything."
"To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to subtract the number of tadpoles that went into hiding or under rocks from the initial count.

Initially, there are 11 tadpoles in the pond. 
Then, 6 of them came out of hiding, leaving us with 11 - 6 = 5 tadpoles visible.
Afterward, 2 of them hid again, leaving us with 5 - 2 = 3 tadpoles visible in the pond.

So, Finn can see 3 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find out the water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Water Depth on Tuesday**: The tank initially had 17 feet of water. On Tuesday, an additional 7 feet of water arrived. Therefore, the total water depth on Tuesday would be:
   \[
   17 \text{ feet} + 7 \text{ feet} = 24 \text{ feet}
   \]

2. **Water Depth on Wednesday**: According to the problem, on Wednesday, the depth of the water is two-thirds of what it was on Tuesday. We calculate this by multiplying the Tuesday's water depth by \( \frac{2}{3} \):
   \[
   \text{Wednesday's Water Depth} = 24 \text{ feet} \times \frac{2}{3} = 16 \text{ feet}
   \]

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"First, let's calculate the number of fish Anakin caught:

- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

Now, let's find out how many fish Locsin caught:

- Starfish: Anakin caught 10, so Locsin caught \( 10 - 5 \)
- Sea horses: Anakin caught 6, so Locsin caught \( 6 - 3 \)
- Clownfish: Anakin caught 3, so Locsin caught \( 3 + 2 \)

Calculating these individually:

- Starfish for Locsin: \( 10 - 5 = 5 \)
- Sea horses for Locsin: \( 6 - 3 = 3 \)
- Clownfish for Locsin: \( 3 + 2 = 5 \)

Adding all the fish together:

- Total stars: \( 10 + 5 = 15 \)
- Total sea horses: \( 6 + 3 = 9 \)
- Total clownfish: \( 3 + 5 = 8 \)

Now, we add them up:

\( 15 (stars) + 9 (sea horses) + 8 (clownfish) = 32 \)

So, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 32 fish."
"To find out how much a bag of marbles will cost after 36 months if its price increases by 20% every two months, we need to calculate the effect of these price increases over time.

Firstly, let's determine the number of intervals (two-month periods) within 36 months:

\[
\frac{36 \text{ months}}{2 \text{ months/interval}} = 18 \text{ intervals}
\]

Since the price increases every two months, there will be 18 such intervals during which the price changes.

Next, we calculate the percentage increase per interval:

\[
20\%
\]

Now, we need to compute the factor by which the price increases after one interval. This can be found using the formula for compound interest:

\[
(1 + r)^n
\]

where \(r\) is the rate of increase (expressed as a decimal), and \(n\) is the number of times it occurs. Here, \(r = 0.20\) and \(n = 18\):

\[
(1 + 0.20)^{18} = 1.2^{18}
\]

Using a calculator, we get:

\[
1.2^{18} \approx 47.528
\]

This means that after 18 intervals, the price of the bag of marbles will be multiplied by approximately 47.528.

Finally, we multiply this factor by the original price of $20 to find the new price:

\[
\$20 \times 47.528 \approx \$950.56
\]

Therefore, the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months would be approximately **$950.56**."
"To find out the total value of all the toys, we need to calculate the value of each type of toy based on the given information:

1. Doll's Cost: 
   Since the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car, it would cost 3*5 + 4 = $23

2. Action Figures' Total Value:
   We know 3 action figures together cost $5 (as per the question), which implies that individually, one action figure would cost $5/3

3. Red Cars' Total Value:
   As mentioned earlier, one red car costs $4

Now, let's add up the values of all the toys:

Total value = Doll's value + Action figures' total value + Red cars' total value
           = $23 + ($5/3)*3 + $4
           = $23 + $5 + $4
           = $32

So, the total value of all the toys is $32."
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant instead of doing the taxes herself, we need to consider both the time value of not being able to do the tax preparation (missed income) and the additional cost of hiring an accountant.

First, let's calculate the missed income:

Missed Income = Number of Hours Lost × Hourly Wage

Number of Hours Lost = 3 hours
Hourly Wage = $35 per hour

Missed Income = 3 hours × $35/hour = $105

Now, let's add the cost of hiring an accountant:

Cost of Hiring Accountant = $90

Finally, we subtract the missed income from the cost of hiring the accountant to find out how much more money Jackie would have if she hired an accountant:

More Money With Accountant = Cost of Hiring Accountant - Missed Income

More Money With Accountant = $90 - $105

However, since missing $105 in income isn't feasible, this calculation doesn't make sense as it results in a negative amount. This indicates that Jackie wouldn't actually lose any money if she hires an accountant because the accountant fee covers the opportunity cost of not doing the tax prep herself.

Therefore, Jackie would neither save nor gain money by hiring an accountant; she would simply pay the same amount ($90) regardless of who performs the task."
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to calculate the total cost of all the items she purchased and subtract it from her budget.

First, let's list out the prices of the items:

- Computer: €1090
- Screen, Keyboard, and Mouse: €157
- Scanner: €157 (same price as the keyboard and mouse)
- CD Burner: €74
- Printer: €102

Now, let's add up these prices:

\[
1090 + 157 + 157 + 74 + 102
\]

Let's break this down step by step:

1. Add the first pair:
   \[
   1090 + 157 = 1247
   \]

2. Add the second pair:
   \[
   1247 + 157 = 1404
   \]

3. Add the third item:
   \[
   1404 + 74 = 1478
   \]

4. Finally, add the last item:
   \[
   1478 + 102 = 1580
   \]

So, the total amount spent on all the items is €1580.

Elvira's budget was €1500. To find out how much money she will have left for her clothing, we subtract the total expenditure from her budget:

\[
1500 - 1580 = -80
\]

Since the result is negative, it indicates that Elvira exceeded her budget by €80. Therefore, she cannot purchase anything because she doesn't have enough money left."
"To find out how many times Sandra has to babysit, we need to calculate the total number of eggs needed for all the flans and then divide by the number of eggs given per babysitting session.

First, let's determine the total number of eggs needed for 15 Spanish flans:

\[ \text{Total Eggs Needed} = \text{Number of Flans} \times \text{Eggs Per Flan} \]
\[ \text{Total Eggs Needed} = 15 \times 3 \]
\[ \text{Total Eggs Needed} = 45 \]

Next, since Sandra gets 9 eggs each time she babysits, we'll calculate how many times she needs to babysit to get enough eggs:

\[ \text{Number of Times to Babysit} = \frac{\text{Total Eggs Needed}}{\text{Eggs Given Per Session}} \]
\[ \text{Number of Times to Babysit} = \frac{45}{9} \]
\[ \text{Number of Times to Babysit} = 5 \]

So, Sandra has to babysit 5 times to gather enough eggs to make 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Seth's current age by \( S \) and Brooke's current age by \( B \).

From the problem statement, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke:

\[ S = 2B \]

We also know that in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:

\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into this equation gives us:

\[ (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Now solve for \( B \):

\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

Since \( S = 2B \), then \( S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \).

So, Seth is currently 16 years old."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we need to use the information given about their amounts of money:

1. We know that Ethel has $8.
2. The problem states that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has.

Let's break this down step by step:

First, calculate twice the amount of money Ethel has:
\[ 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Then add $2 to that amount to find out how much Jimmy has:
\[ 16 + 2 = 18 \]

So, Jimmy has $18."
"In a week, Pancho walks 20 miles every weekday (Monday through Friday), which totals:

20 miles/day × 5 days/week = 100 miles

On Saturdays and Sundays, he walks an additional 10 miles each day:

10 miles/day × 2 days/week = 20 miles

So, in total, Pancho walks:

100 miles (weekday distance) + 20 miles (weekend distance) = 120 miles

Therefore, Pancho walks 120 miles in a week."
"To find the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the cost of each item and then add them together.

First, let's determine the cost of the hat:
\[
\text{Cost of the hat} = \$25
\]

Next, we'll calculate the cost of the jacket, which is three times the cost of the hat:
\[
\text{Cost of the jacket} = 3 \times \$25 = \$75
\]

Now, we'll find the average cost of the hat and the jacket:
\[
\text{Average cost of hat and jacket} = \frac{\$25 + \$75}{2}
\]
\[
= \frac{\$100}{2}
\]
\[
= \$50
\]

Finally, we add up all these individual costs to get the total cost per uniform:
\[
\text{Total cost per uniform} = \text{Cost of the hat} + \text{Cost of the jacket} + \text{Average cost of hat and jacket}
\]
\[
= \$25 + \$75 + \$50
\]
\[
= \$150
\]

So, each uniform costs a total of \$150."
"To find out the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the number of legs for each type of creature and then sum them up:

1. Spiders: Jake sees 80 spiders, and each spider has 8 legs. Therefore, the total number of spider legs is \(80 \times 8\).

2. Insects: Jake sees 90 insects, and each insect has 6 legs. Therefore, the total number of insect legs is \(90 \times 6\).

3. Rare mutant invertebrates: Jake sees 3 rare mutant invertebrates, and each has 10 legs. Therefore, the total number of legs from these creatures is \(3 \times 10\).

Now let's perform the calculations:

For spiders: 
\(80 \times 8 = 640\) legs

For insects:
\(90 \times 6 = 540\) legs

For rare mutant invertebrates:
\(3 \times 10 = 30\) legs

Finally, add all the legs together:
\(640 + 540 + 30 = 1190\) legs

So, Jake sees a total of 1190 legs."
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to determine the ages of each bird based on the given information:

1. **Sally Forty-two (S4)**: We know this is 8 years old.
   
2. **Granny Red (GRed)**: GRed is twice as old as S4, so:
   \[
   GRed = 2 \times S4 = 2 \times 8 = 16 \text{ years old}
   \]

3. **Sally Three** (S3): The problem states that S3 is the same age as S4. Therefore,
   \[
   S3 = S4 = 8 \text{ years old}
   \]

4. **Sally Twenty-two (S22)**: This is not related directly to any other age provided; however, it seems like a mistake since the question mentions ""Sally Thirty-two"" which doesn't match any existing name or calculation. Assuming it was meant to be another bird named differently, let's focus on the correct ones.

Now, adding up the ages of the correctly identified birds:

\[
\text{Total Age} = S4 + GRed + S3 + S22 
\]
\[
= 8 + 16 + 8 + \text{(unknown)} 
\]

Since no additional details about S22 exist, we cannot calculate its exact value. However, if you meant to include it, please provide the correct age of Sally Twenty-two so I could complete the calculation.

For now, considering only the known ages:

\[
\text{Total Age} = 8 + 16 + 8 = 32
\]

So, the total age of the four birds, excluding the unknown S22, would be 32 years. Please clarify if there's an error or missing information regarding Sally Twenty-two's age."
"To calculate how much Jessica will pay per month if she pays 50% more than the minimum payments, we first need to find out what 50% of the minimums are:

Student Loans: \( 50\% \times \$300 = 0.50 \times \$300 = \$150 \)
Credit Card: \( 50\% \times \$200 = 0.50 \times \$200 = \$100 \)
Mortgage: \( 50\% \times \$500 = 0.50 \times \$500 = \$250 \)

Now we add these amounts together to get the total monthly amount Jessica needs to pay:

Total Monthly Payment = Student Loans + Credit Card + Mortgage
Total Monthly Payment = \$150 + \$100 + \$250
Total Monthly Payment = \$500

Since we want to know the yearly amount, we multiply this by 12 months:

Yearly Payment = Total Monthly Payment × 12
Yearly Payment = \$500 × 12
Yearly Payment = \$6,000

So, Jessica would need to pay \$6,000 per year to cover all her debt payments at 50% above the minimums."
"First, we need to calculate the total number of minutes required to prepare all 60 potatoes. Since it takes Billy a minute and a half (which is 90 seconds) to peel each potato, we divide this by 60:

\[
\text{Minutes per potato} = \frac{90}{60} = 1.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Next, we'll find out how long it will take him to cut them. Cutting each potato takes him 5 seconds, which is equivalent to 5/60 or 0.0833 minutes per potato.

To find the total time needed to cut all the potatoes, multiply the number of potatoes by the time it takes to cut each one:

\[
\text{Total cutting time} = 60 \times 0.0833 = 5 \text{ minutes}
\]

Now add the time spent peeling to the time spent cutting:

\[
\text{Total prep time} = 1.5 \text{ minutes (peeling)} + 5 \text{ minutes (cutting)} = 6.5 \text{ minutes}
\]

So, it will take Billy 6.5 minutes to finish preparing the potatoes for the barbecue."
"Let's calculate step by step:

1. First, we need to determine their total revenue. Since they sold 20 glasses per gallon and each glass was sold for $0.50, their total revenue would be 20 gallons × $0.50/gallon = $10.

2. The problem states that they made a $25 profit. Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Expenses. We know their revenue is $10, so if we subtract this from their total expenses ($25), we'll find out what they spent on lemons.

3. Total Expenses (Revenue - Profit) = $25 - $10 = $15

4. Their total expenses include the cost of lemons and sugar. Given that the cost of lemons is $3 per gallon and sugar is $2 per gallon, and knowing that they made 20 glasses per gallon, let's figure out how many gallons they produced.

Since they sold 20 glasses per gallon, and each glass uses one gallon, they produced 20 gallons.

5. Let's denote the number of gallons used for lemons as L and for sugar as S. Thus, L + S = 20.

6. We also know the cost of lemons and sugar per gallon, which is $3 and $2 respectively. Therefore, their total expense equation will be 3L + 2S = $15.

Now we solve these equations simultaneously:

   From equation (i): L + S = 20
   From equation (ii): 3L + 2S = 15
   
Multiply equation (i) by 2:
   2L + 2S = 40

Subtract this from equation (ii):
   3L + 2S - (2L + 2S) = 15 - 40
   L = -25

This doesn't seem right because L shouldn't be negative. I see my mistake; when calculating the total expense, I forgot to consider that Juan and Carlos split the cost evenly between them. So, the correct calculation for the amount spent on lemons is half of $15.

Therefore, they spent $15 / 2 = $7.50 on lemons."
"To find out how many girls were on the Chinese team, we need to first determine the number of Chinese participants in the race. We know there were 240 participants in total, 80 of whom were Japanese. Therefore:

Total participants = Number of Asian participants
240 = Number of Asian participants

Subtracting the number of Japanese participants gives us the number of Chinese participants:

Number of Chinese participants = Total participants - Number of Japanese participants
Number of Chinese participants = 240 - 80
Number of Chinese participants = 160

Now, we're told that the number of boys on the Chinese team was 60. Since the total number of Chinese participants is 160, this means the number of girls would be the remainder when we subtract the number of boys from the total number of Chinese participants:

Number of girls on the Chinese team = Total number of Chinese participants - Number of boys
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 160 - 60
Number of girls on the Chinese team = 100

So, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team."
"First, let's calculate the total expenses:

1. Rent: \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = 1500 \)
2. Car Fuel: \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = 2000 \)

Total spent on rent and car fuel:
\( 1500 + 2000 = 3500 \)

Now we subtract this from Zaid's monthly earnings to find out how much he has left before any donations or spending:

\( 6000 - 3500 = 2500 \)

Next, we need to determine what happens when he donates half of the remaining amount to his charity:

\( \frac{1}{2} \times 2500 = 1250 \)

After donating, he has:

\( 2500 - 1250 = 1250 \)

Finally, we add up all the amounts given to his family members (his daughter and wife):

His daughter receives 200$, his wife receives 700$, plus the 1250$ donation:

\( 200 + 700 + 1250 = 2150 \)

So, Zaid will have \( 1250 - 2150 = -900 \) after all these expenses and donations. This means he would actually owe someone 900$."
"To find out the total number of crabs Rani, Monica, and Bo have together, let's break down the information given:

Bo has 40 crabs.
Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, so Monica has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica, so Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.

Now, we add up all their crabs:
\[ \text{Total} = \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monica's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} \]
\[ \text{Total} = 40 + 36 + 46 \]

Adding these numbers together gives us the total number of crabs:
\[ \text{Total} = 40 + 36 + 46 = 122 \]

So, the three of them have a total of 122 crabs together."
"For the first week, Lloyd earned $10/hour x 5 hours = $50. 
For the second week, Lloyd earned $10/hour x 8 hours = $80. 
So in total, Lloyd earned $50+$80=$130 for the first two weeks."
"To find out how many votes the loser got, we first need to determine how many votes the winner received based on the information provided:

Given:
- The winner received \( \frac{3}{4} \) of the total votes.
- Total number of students who voted in the class was 80.

First, let's calculate the number of votes the winner received:
\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 \]

Now perform the calculation:
\[ \text{Votes for the winner} = \frac{3}{4} \times 80 = 60 \]

Since the total number of votes is 80, the number of votes the loser received would be:
\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = \text{Total votes} - \text{Votes for the winner} \]
\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 80 - 60 \]
\[ \text{Votes for the loser} = 20 \]

So, the loser received 20 votes."
"To determine how many red roses Fred must deliver by 5 PM, we first need to establish the relationships between the different types of flowers:

1. Let \( W \) represent the number of white carnations.
2. According to the problem, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, so the number of red roses is \( 4W \).
3. The number of pink calla lilies is given as 200, and this was five times the number of white carnations, meaning \( 200 = 5W \).

We solve for \( W \):
\[ 200 = 5W \]
\[ W = \frac{200}{5} \]
\[ W = 40 \]

Now that we know there are 40 white carnations, we calculate the number of red roses:
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4W \]
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 4 \times 40 \]
\[ \text{Number of red roses} = 160 \]

Therefore, Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 PM to avoid being switched to another supplier."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Determine Mark's current age**:
   - We know Jan is 30 years old.
   - Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, if we let \( J \) represent Jean's age and \( M \) represent Mark's age, then \( J = M + 2 \).

2. **Analyze the relationship between Jean, Mark, and Jan's ages two years ago**:
   - Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age.
   - Two years ago, Jan was 30 - 2 = 28 years old (since Jean is currently 30).
   - Half of Jan's age two years ago would be \( \frac{28}{2} = 14 \) years old.
   - According to the problem, Mark was 5 years older than this value, which means Mark was \( 14 + 5 = 19 \) years old two years ago.

3. **Find out Mark's current age**:
   - Since two years ago, Mark was 19 years old, his current age must be \( 19 + 2 = 21 \) years old.

4. **Calculate Jean's current age**:
   - As mentioned earlier, Jean is two years older than Mark.
   - Therefore, Jean's current age is \( 21 + 2 = 23 \) years old.

So, Jean is currently 23 years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the time it takes for both teams to complete one lap (400 meters) and find the difference between these times.

### Faster Team

Each member runs at exactly 55 seconds per lap:

1. First runner: 55 seconds
2. Second runner: 55 seconds
3. Third runner: 55 seconds
4. Fourth runner: 55 seconds

Total time for the faster team:
\[ 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} + 55 \text{ seconds} = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

### Slower Team

The slower team's runners take longer due to a decrease in speed:

1. First runner: 60 seconds
2. Second runner: \( 60 - 3 = 57 \) seconds
3. Third runner: \( 57 - 3 = 54 \) seconds
4. Fourth runner: \( 54 - 3 = 51 \) seconds

Total time for the slower team:
\[ 60 \text{ seconds} + 57 \text{ seconds} + 54 \text{ seconds} + 51 \text{ seconds} = 222 \text{ seconds} \]

### Difference in Time

Now subtract the slower team's total time from the faster team's total time:
\[ 220 \text{ seconds} - 222 \text{ seconds} = -2 \text{ seconds} \]

Since the faster team finishes earlier, the slower team loses by 2 seconds.

Thus, the faster team wins by **2 seconds**."
"To determine how much more likely it is that Jerry rolls a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate both probabilities separately and then find the difference between them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A standard six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore:

- Number of favorable outcomes (rolling a number greater than 3): \(3\)
- Total possible outcomes: \(6\)

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3:
\[ P(\text{number > 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

Even numbers on a six-sided die are 2, 4, and 6. To roll two even numbers in a row, the first must be an even number and the second must also be even. 

- Number of favorable outcomes (two even numbers):
  - First roll is even: 3 possibilities (2, 4, or 6)
  - Second roll is even given the first was even: 2 possibilities (remaining even numbers, since one has already been rolled)
  
  Total favorable outcomes for two even numbers: \(3 \times 2 = 6\).

- Total possible outcomes: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) (since each roll is independent).

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:
\[ P(\text{two even numbers}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total possible outcomes}} = \frac{6}{36} = \frac{1}{6} \approx 0.1667 \]

### Step 3: Find the difference in probabilities

Now, let's find out by what percentage the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 exceeds the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row:

Difference in probabilities:
\[ \Delta P = P(\text{number > 3}) - P(\text{two even numbers}) = 0.5 - 0.1667 \]

Convert this to a percentage:
\[ \Delta P \times 100\% = (0.5 - 0.16"
"To find out how many apples Jenna and her mother picked together, we need to first determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother, and her mother picked 20 apples, Jenna picked:

\( \frac{20}{2} = 10 \)

So, Jenna picked 10 apples. 

Now, to find out the total number of apples they both picked, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked:

\( 20 (mother's apples) + 10 (Jenna's apples) = 30 \)

Therefore, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples."
"Let's break down the information provided:

- Rats are kept in 3 cages in equal groups.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone.
- Each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw.
- A pen of rabbits receives 20 pieces of straw.
- In total, 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents (rats and hamsters).

First, let's calculate the total number of pieces of straw distributed to the hamsters:

Number of cages of hamsters = 10
Pieces of straw per hamster = 5

Total pieces of straw for hamsters = Number of cages × Pieces of straw per hamster
= 10 × 5
= 50 pieces

Next, we subtract this amount from the total distribution to find out how many pieces of straw were used for the rats:

Total distribution of straw = 160 pieces
Straw used for hamsters = 50 pieces

Remaining straw for rats = Total distribution - Straw used for hamsters
= 160 - 50
= 110 pieces

Now, we know each rat gets 6 pieces of straw. To find out how many rats there are, we divide the remaining straw by the amount per rat:

Number of rats = Remaining straw / Straw per rat
= 110 / 6
≈ 18.33 rats

Since we cannot have a fraction of a rat, we round up to the nearest whole number because even if one rat isn't fully occupied, it would require an additional piece of straw.

Therefore, Russell distributes 19 rats into the 3 cages, with each cage containing approximately 6.33 rats (rounded up). Since you can't split a rodent, there must be a slight discrepancy here. However, based on the initial conditions and calculations, there are 19 rats in total across the three cages."
"To calculate the amount Mandy needs to pay Benedict, we need to consider both the principal amount ($100) and the monthly interest (2% per month).

First, let's find out the monthly interest on the initial $100:

Monthly Interest = Principal × Monthly Interest Rate

Given that the monthly interest rate is 2%, or 0.02 as a decimal:

Monthly Interest = $100 × 0.02
                = $2

Now, since this interest accumulates over three months, we'll add up the interest for each month:

Total Interest Over 3 Months = Monthly Interest × Number of Months
                            = $2 × 3
                            = $6

So, the total amount Mandy owes Benedict is the sum of the principal and the total interest:

Total Amount Owed = Principal + Total Interest Over 3 Months
                  = $100 + $6
                  = $106

Therefore, if Mandy pays Benedict after 3 months, she should give him $106."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Cost of buying the bags**: The trader buys each bag for $20. Let \( n \) represent the number of bags bought. Therefore, the total cost of buying these bags is \( 20n \).

2. **Transportation cost**: Each bag incurs a transportation cost of $2. Thus, the total transportation cost for \( n \) bags is \( 2n \).

3. **Total cost**: The total amount spent on both buying and transporting the bags is:
   \[
   20n + 2n = 22n
   \]

4. **Profit calculation**: The trader makes a profit of $400 after selling all the bags. Profit is calculated as revenue minus cost. The selling price per bag is $30, so if the trader sells \( n \) bags, the total revenue is \( 30n \). Therefore, the profit equation is:
   \[
   30n - 22n = 400
   \]
   
5. **Solve for \( n \)**: Simplify the equation to find \( n \):
   \[
   30n - 22n = 400 \\
   8n = 400 \\
   n = \frac{400}{8} \\
   n = 50
   \]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, we need to calculate the total amount spent on the rides. Since each ride costs $33 and they went on 2 rides, the total cost for the rides would be:

\[ 2 \times 33 = \$66 \]

Next, let's find out how much was spent on food. According to the problem, this amount is $4.50 less than what was spent on the tickets, so:

\[ \$20.25 (tickets) - \$4.50 = \$15.75 (food) \]

Now, let's add up the amounts spent on tickets, food, and rides to get the total expenditure:

\[ \$20.25 (tickets) + \$15.75 (food) + \$66 (rides) = \$102.00 \]

Since the three friends agreed to share the total expenses equally, we divide the total by 3:

\[ \$102.00 ÷ 3 = \$34.00 \]

So, each friend paid $34.00."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, you need to multiply the number of minutes he works by the number of peaches he collects per minute:

\[ \text{Total Peaches} = \text{Minutes Worked} \times \text{Peaches Per Minute} \]

Given that John works for 3 hours (which is 180 minutes) and collects 2 peaches per minute:

\[ \text{Total Peaches} = 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} \]
\[ \text{Total Peaches} = 360 \text{ peaches} \]

So, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the entire flock needs per day, we first need to calculate the weekly insect consumption and then divide it by 7 (since there are 7 days in a week).

First, let's find out the weekly insect consumption:

\[
\text{Weekly insect consumption} = \text{Number of ducks} \times \text{Insect consumption per duck per week}
\]

Given that there are 10 ducks and each duck consumes 3.5 pounds of insects per week:

\[
\text{Weekly insect consumption} = 10 \times 3.5 = 35 \text{ pounds}
\]

Now, we want to know this amount over a period of 7 days, which means we need to divide the weekly consumption by 7:

\[
\text{Daily insect consumption} = \frac{\text{Weekly insect consumption}}{7}
\]

So,

\[
\text{Daily insect consumption} = \frac{35}{7} = 5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Therefore, the entire flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To solve this problem, let's break it down into steps:

1. **Initial number of trees**: Tom starts with 50 trees.

2. **Annual tree growth**:
   - Tom plants 10 new trees each year.
   - He also loses 2 trees each year due to chopping them down.

   Therefore, the net gain in trees per year is \(10 - 2 = 8\) trees.

3. **Total trees over 10 years**:
   - Over 10 years, the net gain would be \(8 \times 10 = 80\) trees.

   Adding these to the initial amount:
   \[
   50 + 80 = 130 \text{ trees}
   \]

4. **Trees that die after 10 years**:
   - The problem states that 30% of the trees die after 10 years.

   To find out how many trees die:
   \[
   0.30 \times 130 = 39 \text{ trees}
   \]

5. **Final number of trees**:
   - Subtract the number of trees that died from the total number of trees grown over 10 years:
   \[
   130 - 39 = 91 \text{ trees}
   \]

So, after 10 years, Tom will have 91 trees left."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Friday**: The neighbors place 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard. 

2. **Saturday**: They take back one-third of the flamingos and paint them white. To find out how many flamingos this is, we calculate one-third of 18:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 18 = 6
   \]
   So, they remove 6 flamingos and paint them white.

3. **Sunday**: They add another 18 pink plastic flamingos to the collection. Therefore, the number of pink flamingos increases by 18:
   \[
   18 (initially) + 18 (added) = 36
   \]

4. **White Flamingos Calculation**:
   Since 6 flamingos were taken away and turned into white ones, the number of white flamingos remains 6.

Now, let's compare the number of pink and white flamingos at noon on Sunday:
\[
\text{Number of pink flamingos} = 36
\]
\[
\text{Number of white flamingos} = 6
\]

Finally, we need to find out how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos:
\[
36 - 6 = 30
\]

Therefore, there are 30 more pink plastic flamingos out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday."
"To determine how much change Violetta will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of buying one crayon.
2. Multiply the cost per crayon by the number of different colors Violetta wants.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta prepared.

Let's go through these calculations step by step:

1. The cost of one crayon is $2.
2. Violetta wants to buy 5 different colors of crayons. Therefore, the total cost for all the crayons is \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \).
3. Violetta prepared $20 for this purchase. To find out how much change she will receive, we subtract the total cost of the crayons from the amount she prepared:
   \[
   20 - 10 = 10
   \]

So, Violetta will get back $10 in change."
"First, let's find out the cost of one pen:

Pen = Pencil + Eraser
Pencil = $1.20
Eraser = $0.30

So,
Pencil + Eraser = $1.20 + $0.30 = $1.50

Now we know that a pen costs $1.50.

Next, let's calculate the cost of 8 pens:

Cost of 8 pens = Cost of 1 pen × Number of pens
               = $1.50 × 8
               = $12.00

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, you need to calculate how many pounds of carrots are given to all the restaurants and subtract it from the total amount of carrots available.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants:

\( 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} \times 40 \text{ restaurants} = 80 \text{ pounds} \)

Now, subtract this number from the total amount of carrots available:

\( 200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds} \)

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find out how many children are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = 23786
Number of men = 8417
Number of women = 9092

So, the number of children would be:

Children = Total population - Number of men - Number of women
Children = 23786 - 8417 - 9092
Children = 6377

Therefore, there are 6377 children in Soda."
"Let's calculate the number of Pokemon cards Elaine has step by step:

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.

After collecting three times that amount (in the first month), she would have:
20 x 3 = 60 cards

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which was 60 cards:
60 - 20 = 40 cards

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of cards she collected in the first and second months, which was 60 + 40 = 100 cards:
100 x 2 = 200 cards

Now, let's add up all the cards she has now:

Initial cards: 20
First month collection: 60
Second month collection: 40
Third month collection: 200

Total cards = 20 + 60 + 40 + 200 = 320 cards

So, Elaine now has 320 Pokemon cards in total."
"First find the total amount Mark makes from Publisher A by multiplying the number of sentences he edits there by the amount he gets paid per sentence: 1000 sentences/week × 5 cents/sentence = 5000 cents/week

Then double this amount because Publisher B pays twice as much: 5000 cents/week × 2 = 10000 cents/week

Finally add these amounts together to find how much Mark makes in total each week: 10000 cents/week + 5000 cents/week = 15000 cents/week

Therefore, Mark makes 15000 cents in a week."
"To calculate the total amount of water Baldur gets every day, we need to multiply the number of pails he uses during the morning by the volume of water per pail, then do the same calculation for the afternoon, and finally add those two amounts together.

First, let's find out how much water Baldur gets in the morning:

Morning water intake = Number of pails used in the morning × Volume of water per pail
= 5 pails × 5 liters/pail
= 25 liters

Next, let's find out how much water Baldur gets in the afternoon:

Afternoon water intake = Number of pails used in the afternoon × Volume of water per pail
= 6 pails × 5 liters/pail
= 30 liters

Now, let's add both amounts together to find the total daily water intake:

Total daily water intake = Morning water intake + Afternoon water intake
= 25 liters + 30 liters
= 55 liters

So, Baldur gets 55 liters of water every day."
"First, we calculate John's new salary after receiving the 5% raise:

New Salary = Current Salary + (Current Salary * Raise Percentage)
           = $2000 + ($2000 * 0.05)
           = $2000 + $100
           = $2100

Next, we calculate the total amount of money John made throughout the year by adding the one-time monetary reward of $5000 to his annual salary increase over the course of the year:

Total Annual Income = One-Time Reward + (Annual Salary Increase * Number of Weeks in Year)

Since there are 52 weeks in a year, we multiply the annual salary increase by 52:

Annual Salary Increase = New Salary - Current Salary
                      = $2100 - $2000
                      = $100

Now we add this to the one-time reward:

Total Annual Income = $5000 + ($100 * 52)
                   = $5000 + $5200
                   = $10,200

So, John made $10,200 during the entire year."
"To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of grapes produced by the entire farm.
2. Determine how many barrels of wine can be made from those grapes.

First, calculate the total amount of grapes produced by the entire farm. Since the farm consists of 10 acres and each acre produces 5 tons of grapes per year, the total production is:
\[ 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons/year} \]

Next, since each ton of grapes makes 2 barrels of wine, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:
\[ 50 \text{ tons/year} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels/year} \]

So, the farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Sandwiches:** Carl eats a sandwich every day for lunch. This week (7 days), he will eat \( 7 \times 2 = 14 \) slices of cheese because he uses 2 slices of cheese per sandwich.

2. **Omelets:** Carl eats an omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week. The number of slices used per omelet increases by one slice compared to the sandwiches. Therefore, if he uses 2 slices of cheese per sandwich, then for each omelet, he uses 3 slices (since 2+1=3).

   Over the course of 3 days, the total number of slices for the omelets would be \( 3 \times 3 = 9 \) slices.

3. **Big Dish of Macaroni and Cheese:** He makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese and uses 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese:

\[
14 \text{ (sandwiches)} + 9 \text{ (omelets)} + 8 \text{ (macaroni and cheese)} = 31 \text{ slices}
\]

Therefore, Carl used 31 slices of cheese over the course of the week."
"To find out how many pens Janet has now, we need to calculate the number of pens in each color and then sum them up.

For green pens:
She initially had 22 green pens and didn't buy any more, so she still has 22 green pens.

For yellow pens:
She initially had 10 yellow pens and didn't buy any more, so she still has 10 yellow pens.

For blue pens:
Each bag contains 9 pens, and she bought 6 bags, so she has 9 x 6 = 54 blue pens.

For red pens:
Each bag contains 6 pens, and she bought 2 bags, so she has 6 x 2 = 12 red pens.

Now, let's add all these together:

Green pens: 22
Yellow pens: 10
Blue pens: 54
Red pens: 12

Total pens = 22 (green) + 10 (yellow) + 54 (blue) + 12 (red)
Total pens = 98

So, Janet has a total of 98 pens now."
"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93 across all six tests, we follow these steps:

First, let's calculate the sum of her current scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 \]

Adding these together:
\[ 89 + 71 = 160 \]
\[ 160 + 92 = 252 \]
\[ 252 + 100 = 352 \]
\[ 352 + 86 = 438 \]

So, the total sum of her current scores is 438.

Next, let's determine what the new total score will be if she gets a perfect score (100) on the sixth test:
\[ 438 + 100 = 538 \]

Now, we want to find out what score \( x \) she needs on the sixth test such that the average of all six tests equals 93. The formula for the average of six numbers is the sum of those numbers divided by 6. We set this equal to 93 and solve for \( x \):

\[
\frac{538 + x}{6} = 93
\]

Multiply both sides by 6 to clear the fraction:
\[
538 + x = 558
\]

Subtract 538 from both sides to isolate \( x \):
\[
x = 558 - 538
\]
\[
x = 20
\]

Therefore, Brinley needs to score 20 on the sixth test to have an average of 93 over all six tests."
"To calculate the total distance Micheal covered by biking:

For the first part:
He biked at least 5 times per week for 4 weeks, making it 5 x 4 = 20 times.
Each time he went on a trip of 25 km, thus covering 20 x 25 = 500 km.

For the second part:
He biked 2 times a week for 3 weeks, which was 2 x 3 = 6 trips.
Each trip was 60 km long, so this resulted in 6 x 60 = 360 km.

Adding both parts together gives us the total distance:
Total distance = 500 km (first part) + 360 km (second part) = 860 km

So, Micheal covered a total of 860 kilometers by biking over these periods."
"To determine the total weight of Joe's bag of Halloween candy, we need to calculate the weight of the chocolate bars and the candied apples separately, then sum these weights.

First, let's find out the weight of one candied apple. We know that each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as a candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, each candied apple must weigh half of that:

\[
\text{Weight of one candied apple} = \frac{\text{Weight of one chocolate bar}}{2} = \frac{40}{2} = 20 \text{ grams}
\]

Next, we calculate the total weight of the 25 chocolate bars:

\[
\text{Total weight of chocolate bars} = 25 \times 40 \text{ grams} = 1000 \text{ grams}
\]

Now, we calculate the total weight of the 80 candied apples:

\[
\text{Total weight of candied apples} = 80 \times 20 \text{ grams} = 1600 \text{ grams}
\]

Finally, we add the weights of all the chocolate bars and candied apples together to get the total weight of the candy in Joe's bag:

\[
\text{Total weight of candy} = 1000 \text{ grams} + 1600 \text{ grams} = 2600 \text{ grams}
\]

So, Joe's bag of Halloween candy weighs **2600 grams**."
"To determine the total number of cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many cakes Rose bought on Tuesday:
She bought three times the number of cakes she bought on Monday. Since she bought 4 cakes on Monday, she bought \(3 \times 4 = 12\) cakes on Tuesday.

Next, let's calculate the number of cakes she bought on Wednesday:
She bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday. Since she bought 12 cakes on Tuesday, she bought \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes on Wednesday.

Now, we add up the cakes bought over the three days:
- Monday: 4 cakes
- Tuesday: 12 cakes
- Wednesday: 60 cakes

So, the total number of cakes Rose bought after all three days is \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).

Therefore, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate the cost of half a dozen plates**: 
   \[
   \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = 6 \times 6000 = \$36000
   \]

2. **Determine the relationship between the number of cups and plates**:
   According to the question, twenty dozen cups cost \( \$1200 \) less than half a dozen plates.
   
   Let \( C \) represent the cost per cup.

3. **Set up the equation based on the given information**:
   The cost of one dozen cups is \( 12C \), and since there are twenty dozens of cups, the total cost for all cups would be \( 20 \times 12C \).

   Therefore, we set up the equation:
   \[
   20 \times 12C = 36000 - 1200
   \]
   
4. **Simplify and solve for \( C \)**:
   First, simplify inside the parentheses:
   \[
   20 \times 12C = 36000 - 1200 \\
   240C = 34800
   \]
   
   Divide both sides by 240 to isolate \( C \):
   \[
   C = \frac{34800}{240}
   \]
   
   Simplify the division:
   \[
   C = 145
   \]

Therefore, the cost of each cup is \( \$145 \)."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford both the jacket and shoes, we'll first calculate the total cost of these items.

The cost of the jacket is $30.
Each pair of shoes costs $20, and since she wants 2 pairs, the total cost for the shoes will be \(2 \times \$20 = \$40\).

Adding the cost of the jacket and the shoes together gives us the total amount needed:

\[ \$30 (\text{jacket}) + \$40 (\text{shoes}) = \$70 \]

Now, let's consider Sara's earnings from babysitting and mowing the lawn:

She earns $5 per babysitting session and saves $4 each time she mows the lawn.

Let's denote the number of babysitting sessions as \( x \). Therefore, her savings from babysitting would be \( 5x - 4 \) (since she saves $4 each time she mows the lawn).

We need to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn to make up the difference between what she needs ($70) and what she currently has ($10):

\[ 5x - 4 = 70 - 10 \]
\[ 5x - 4 = 60 \]
\[ 5x = 64 \]
\[ x = \frac{64}{5} \]
\[ x = 12.8 \]

Since Sara cannot mow lawns a fraction of a time, she needs to round up to the nearest whole number because even if she finishes one last session partially, it counts towards her goal. Thus, Sara needs to mow the lawn **13** times to earn enough money to afford both the jacket and shoes.

Therefore, Sara needs to mow the lawn **13** times to save enough money to buy the jacket and shoes."
"Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W.

From the information given, we know:

1. The red chickens produce 3 eggs per day, so in one day, the total egg production by red chickens is 3R.
2. The white chickens produce 5 eggs per day, so in one day, the total egg production by white chickens is 5W.
3. Every day, Jerry collects 42 eggs, which means the sum of the daily egg productions by both types of chickens equals 42 eggs: 3R + 5W = 42.

We also know that Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens, which gives us another equation:

4. W = R + 2

Now we have a system of equations:

a) 3R + 5W = 42 (total eggs collected)
b) W = R + 2 (two more white chickens)

Substituting equation b into equation a, we get:

3R + 5(R + 2) = 42

Simplifying this equation:

3R + 5R + 10 = 42

8R = 32

Dividing both sides by 8:

R = 4

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how long Gary spends walking, we need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park and then divide it by his walking speed.

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the park:

Perimeter (P) = 2(length + width)

Given the dimensions of the park:
Length = 6 miles
Width = 1.5 miles

So,
P = 2(6 + 1.5)
P = 2(7.5)
P = 15 miles

Now, we know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:

Time (T) = Distance (D) / Speed (S)

Where:
Distance (D) = 15 miles
Speed (S) = 3 miles per hour

So,

T = 15 miles / 3 mph
T = 5 hours

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the edge of the park."
"On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day. Since there were 100 customers on the first day, the number of customers on the second day would be:

\( 100 \text{ (first day)} + 50 \text{ (additional customers)} = 150 \text{ customers} \)

Now, we know that the total number of customers over the three days was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers from the first and second days from the total:

\( 500 \text{ (total customers)} - 150 \text{ (second day)} - 100 \text{ (first day)} = 250 \text{ customers} \)

So, Sloane counted 250 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as S gallons and the current amount of water in the big pool as B gallons.

From the problem statement, we know that:

1. The leak rate is 4 gallons per minute.
2. Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool.
3. Now, the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool.

First, let's express these conditions mathematically:

- Since the leak rate is 4 gallons per minute, four minutes ago, the big pool would have leaked out \(4 \times 4 = 16\) gallons, leaving it with \(B - 16\) gallons.
- At this point, the small pool had half the amount of water in the big pool because it was twice as much four minutes ago. Thus, the small pool had \(\frac{B}{2}\) gallons.

Now, since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can write:

\[B = 4S\]

We also know that four minutes ago, the big pool had \(\frac{B}{2}\) gallons, which means before leaking, it had:

\[B - 16 = \frac{B}{2}\]

Substituting \(B = 4S\) into the equation:

\[4S - 16 = \frac{4S}{2} = 2S\]

Now, solving for \(S\):

\[4S - 2S = 16\]
\[2S = 16\]
\[S = 8\]

So, the small pool currently has 8 gallons of water."
"To find out how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and belt, we first need to calculate the total cost:

Cost of shoes = $320.00
Cost of belt = $32.00

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now we know that Lori's hourly wage is $8.00 per hour. To find out how many hours she needs to work, we divide the total cost by her hourly wage:

Number of hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00
Number of hours needed = 44 hours

So, Lori will have to work 44 hours before she can afford both the shoes and the belt."
"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance, we first need to determine the total amount she needs to repay. This includes the original loan plus an additional 10% interest on the principal.

First, let's calculate the interest:

Interest = Principal × Rate
         = $2000 × 10%
         = $2000 × 0.10
         = $200

Now, add the interest to the principal to get the total repayment amount:

Total Repayment Amount = Principal + Interest
                      = $2000 + $200
                      = $2200

Next, we'll calculate the total amount paid over the course of 12 months at $165 per month:

Total Paid Over 12 Months = Monthly Payment × Number of Months
                         = $165 × 12
                         = $1980

Finally, subtract the total amount paid from the total repayment amount to find out Janeth's remaining balance:

Remaining Balance = Total Repayment Amount - Total Paid Over 12 Months
                  = $2200 - $1980
                  = $220

So, Janeth's remaining balance by the end of 12 months would be $220."
"To find out the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to add the number of roses and dahlias together.

Number of roses: 4

Number of dahlias: Number of roses + 7

Since there are 7 more dahlias than roses:

Number of dahlias = 4 (roses) + 7 = 11 dahlias

Total number of flowers:

Total = Number of roses + Number of dahlias
Total = 4 + 11 = 15 flowers

So, there are a total of 15 flowers in the vase."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we first need to determine their current ages and then add three years to each one before calculating the average.

Given:
- Harriet's current age = 21 years

First, calculate Adrian's current age:
- Adrian's age = 3 times Harriet's age
\[ \text{Adrian's age} = 3 \times 21 = 63 \]

Next, calculate Zack's current age:
- Harriet is half the age of Zack, so Zack's age = 2 times Harriet's age
\[ \text{Zack's age} = 2 \times 21 = 42 \]

Now, add three years to each person's current age:
- Harriet's age in three years = \(21 + 3\)
\[ \text{Harriet's future age} = 24 \]
- Adrian's age in three years = \(63 + 3\)
\[ \text{Adrian's future age} = 66 \]
- Zack's age in three years = \(42 + 3\)
\[ \text{Zack's future age} = 45 \]

Finally, calculate the average age by adding these future ages together and dividing by 3:
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{(24 + 66 + 45)}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average age} = \frac{135}{3} \]
\[ \text{Average age} = 45 \]

Therefore, the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years will be 45 years."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. The total number of points scored by four students is 251.
2. Naomi scored 68 points.
3. Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi.
4. Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi.

First, let's calculate the points scored by Yuri:

Yuri's points = (1/2 * Naomi's points) + 10
              = (1/2 * 68) + 10
              = 34 + 10
              = 44

Now, we know that Naomi, Yuri, and Brianna together scored 68 + 44 + 68 = 180 points.

To find out how many points Jojo scored, we subtract this sum from the total number of points:

Jojo's points = Total points - Points scored by others
             = 251 - 180
             = 71

Therefore, Jojo scored 71 points."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent on solving crosswords and Sudoku over the weekend, we need to multiply the number of each type of puzzle by the time it took to solve them:

For crosswords:
10 minutes/puzzle × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

For Sudoku:
5 minutes/puzzle × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, add both times together:
30 minutes (crosswords) + 40 minutes (Sudoku) = 70 minutes

Carmen spent 70 minutes in total solving these games over the weekend."
"To find out how many liters of water are left in the tank, we first need to subtract the amount of water Celine used from the initial amount:

Initial amount of water in the tank: 120 liters

Amount of water Celine used: 90 liters

Water remaining after Celine used some: 120 liters - 90 liters = 30 liters

Now, let's calculate how much rainwater Celine collected:

Rainwater collected (twice as much as what was left): 2 * 30 liters = 60 liters

Finally, add the rainwater collected back into the tank:

Total water in the tank now: Water remaining + Rainwater collected
= 30 liters + 60 liters
= 90 liters

So, there are 90 liters of water in the tank now."
"To find out how many flowers Andy plants in total, we need to first determine the number of petunias he plants.

Given:
- Number of geraniums planted = 90
- Number of petunias is 40 less than the number of geraniums

So,
Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40
Number of petunias = 90 - 40
Number of petunias = 50

Now, to find the total number of flowers Andy plants:

Total number of flowers = Number of geraniums + Number of petunias
Total number of flowers = 90 + 50
Total number of flowers = 140

Therefore, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."
"To find the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **First Year Advertising**: The company spends $15,000 on advertising for the first year.

2. **Second Year Advertising**: They spend a third of the first year's amount on the second year. 
   \[
   \text{Amount spent in the second year} = \frac{1}{3} \times \$15,000
   \]
   Calculate this:
   \[
   \frac{1}{3} \times 15,000 = 5,000
   \]

3. **Total Amount Spent**:
   Add the amounts spent over both years:
   \[
   \text{Total amount} = \$15,000 + \$5,000
   \]
   Perform the addition:
   \[
   15,000 + 5,000 = 20,000
   \]

Therefore, the total amount the company spent on advertising for the two years is \( \$20,000 \)."
"To find out how much Carlos and Benji will pay for their rentals altogether, we need to calculate the cost of renting each item separately and then add them together.

For Carlos's canoe rental:

Cost per hour = $30
Time rented = 3 hours

Total cost for Carlos = Cost per hour × Time rented
Total cost for Carlos = $30/hour × 3 hours
Total cost for Carlos = $90

For Benji's banana boat raft rental:

Cost per hour = $18
Time rented = 5 hours

Total cost for Benji = Cost per hour × Time rented
Total cost for Benji = $18/hour × 5 hours
Total cost for Benji = $90

Now we'll add both totals together:

Total cost for both rentals = Total cost for Carlos + Total cost for Benji
Total cost for both rentals = $90 + $90
Total cost for both rentals = $180

So, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of $180 for their rentals altogether."
"To determine the total number of days Andrew will spend traveling from New Jersey to Rochester and back, we need to calculate the time spent on each leg of the journey separately and then sum them up.

First, let's find out how many days it takes to travel from New Jersey to Rochester by bus:

It takes 6 days to travel by bus.

Next, we know that it takes half as many days to travel by car compared to driving by bus. Therefore, the time taken by car would be:

\[ \text{Time by car} = \frac{\text{Time by bus}}{2} = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \text{ days} \]

Now, since Andrew wants to go to Rochester by bus and return from Rochester by car, we add these times together:

\[ \text{Total days} = (\text{Days by bus}) + (\text{Days by car}) = 6 + 3 = 9 \]

So, Andrew will travel for a total of 9 days.

Therefore, Andrew will travel for **9 days**."
"To find the probability that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we first need to calculate the new number of water type cards James has after losing some and buying others:

Original number of water type cards: 40
Lost: 8
Bought: 14

New number of water type cards: 40 - 8 + 14 = 46

Now, we'll divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards to get the probability as a fraction:

Probability = Number of water type cards / Total number of cards
            = 46 / (30 + 20 + 40)
            = 46 / 90

To convert this fraction into a percentage, we multiply it by 100:

Percentage = (Number of water type cards / Total number of cards) × 100
           = (46 / 90) × 100 ≈ 51.11%

Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is approximately 51%."

"First we need to determine how fast both Kalinda and her mom can put together. Since Kalinda puts together 4 pieces every minute, then her mom can put together half that amount or 2 pieces per minute. Together, they can put together 4+2=6 pieces per minute.

Now let's calculate how long it would take to finish the puzzle:

360 / 6 = 60 minutes

Since an hour has 60 minutes, 60 minutes equals 1 hour. Therefore, it will take them 1 hour to complete the puzzle."
"To determine how many watermelons were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn took home initially:**
   - The initial count was 120 watermelons.
   - 30% of these were ready for harvest.
   \[
   0.30 \times 120 = 36 \text{ watermelons}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of watermelons remaining after Ashlyn took 36 home:**
   \[
   120 - 36 = 84 \text{ watermelons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of watermelons Ashlyn harvested two weeks later:**
   - Three-quarters (3/4) of the remaining watermelons were ready for harvest.
   \[
   \frac{3}{4} \times 84 = 63 \text{ watermelons}
   \]

4. **Find the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the second visit:**
   - Subtract the number of harvested watermelons from the remaining watermelons.
   \[
   84 - 63 = 21 \text{ watermelons}
   \]

Thus, the number of watermelons that were not ready to be harvested after the two weeks is \(\boxed{21}\)."
"First, calculate the total cost of the cars before taxes and registration fees:

\[ \text{Total Cost of Cars} = 12 \times \$20,000 = \$240,000 \]

Next, calculate the tax amount:

\[ \text{Tax Amount} = 10\% \times \$240,000 = 0.10 \times \$240,000 = \$24,000 \]

Now add the registration fee for all cars:

\[ \text{Registration Fee} = 12 \times \$1,000 = \$12,000 \]

Finally, add up all these amounts to get the total payment:

\[ \text{Total Payment} = \text{Total Cost of Cars} + \text{Tax Amount} + \text{Registration Fee} \]
\[ \text{Total Payment} = \$240,000 + \$24,000 + \$12,000 = \$276,000 \]

So Mark pays a total of $276,000 for everything."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells.
   - Therefore, Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert.
   - This means Kylie collected \(20 + 5 = 25\) shells on Monday.

2. On Tuesday, Kylie collected 2 times more shells than she did on Monday.
   - To find out how many shells Kylie collected on Tuesday, we multiply the number of shells she collected on Monday by 2.
   - Thus, Kylie collected \(25 \times 2 = 50\) shells on Tuesday.

So, Kylie collected **50 shells** on Tuesday."
"To find out the total number of insects in the garden, we need to first determine the number of bugs based on the information given.

Given:
- Number of ants = 50
- Number of bugs is half as many as the number of ants

Now, let's calculate the number of bugs:

Number of bugs = (1/2) × Number of ants
Number of bugs = (1/2) × 50
Number of bugs = 25

So, there are 25 bugs in the garden.

Next, let's add the number of ants and bugs together to get the total number of insects:

Total number of insects = Number of ants + Number of bugs
Total number of insects = 50 + 25
Total number of insects = 75

Therefore, there are a total of 75 insects in the garden."
"To find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing, we need to calculate how many penguins jumped into the ocean and went inside the cave first.

One-third of the 36 penguins jumped into the ocean:
\( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)

Another one-third went inside the cave to eat dinner:
\( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)

Now, let's add these numbers together to see how many penguins have gone away:

\( 12 (jumped into the ocean) + 12 (went inside the cave) = 24 \)

Subtract this number from the original amount to find out how many penguins are still left sunbathing:

\( 36 (original number) - 24 (gone) = 12 \)

So, there are 12 penguins still left sunbathing."
"To determine how many vines Steve needs, we'll first calculate how many tomatoes he eats daily, then find out how many weeks' worth of tomatoes this represents, and finally figure out how many vines it would take to produce that amount over a period of time.

1. **Calculate Daily Tomato Consumption**:
   - Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend.
   - Let's denote the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day as \( x \).
   - Therefore, Steve eats \( 2x \) tomatoes per day.
   - We know from the problem statement that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.
   - So, \( 2x = 6 \).

2. **Solve for \( x \)**:
   - Divide both sides by 2 to isolate \( x \):
     \[
     x = \frac{6}{2} = 3
     \]
   - This tells us that Steve's girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day.

3. **Calculate Weekly Tomato Consumption**:
   - Since Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, and there are 7 days in a week,
     \[
     \text{Weekly consumption} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \text{ tomatoes}
     \]

4. **Determine Number of Vines Needed**:
   - A single vine produces 3 tomatoes per week.
   - To find out how many vines are needed to produce 42 tomatoes per week, divide the weekly requirement by the production rate of one vine:
     \[
     \text{Number of vines} = \frac{42}{3} = 14
     \]

So, Steve needs 14 vines to ensure he always has enough fresh cherry tomatoes for himself and his girlfriend."
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
   Since each friend gets 4 slices and there are 20 friends, we multiply the number of friends by the number of slices per friend:
   \[
   20 \text{ friends} \times 4 \text{ slices per friend} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Determine how many slices one pizza provides.
   Each pizza is sliced into 8 portions.

3. Calculate the number of pizzas required based on the total number of slices needed.
   To find out how many pizzas are needed, divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per pizza:
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices per pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

Therefore, John needs to order **10 pizzas** to ensure everyone gets 4 slices each."
"If Ram uses five empty pens to make one full pen, then for every six pens (five empty plus one filled), he gets one additional pen.

Given that he starts with 25 pens:

- First, calculate how many sets of ""six"" pens fit into 25: \( \frac{25}{6} = 4\) remainder \(1\).
This means he can make \(4\) complete sets of ""six"" pens (which will give him 4 extra pens because there's a remainder).

So, if he makes 4 full sets, he will have \(4 \times 5 = 20\) empty pens used up and 4 unused.

Adding these to his original 25 pens, we get a total of \(25 + 4 = 29\) pens.

Therefore, Ram ends up with 29 pens after using all the ink from the initial set of 25 pens."
"To find out how much money Johnny had after a year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money Johnny initially had by adding the extra $10 to his initial allowance of $20.
   \[
   \$20 (initial allowance) + \$10 (extra) = \$30 (total)
   \]

2. Since the money tripled in a year, multiply the total amount by 3.
   \[
   \$30 \times 3 = \$90
   \]

Therefore, after one year, Johnny would have $\$90$."
"First, let's determine the age of Joan:

Joan is five years older than Jessa, who is 20 years old. Therefore, Joan is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.

Now, we know Mary is two years younger than Joan. Since Joan is 25 years old, Mary must be 25 - 2 = 23 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add them together:

Jessa's age (20) + Joan's age (25) + Mary's age (23)

20 + 25 + 23 = 68

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years."
"To solve this problem, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A**:
   - 30% of the initial 1000 students went out through exit A.
   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit A} = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300
   \]

2. **Determine the number of students remaining after those through exit A**:
   - Subtract the number of students through exit A from the total number of students.
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 1000 - 300 = 700
   \]

3. **Calculate the number of students who went out through exit B**:
   - \( \frac{3}{5} \) of the remaining students went out through exit B.
   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit B} = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420
   \]

4. **Determine the number of students remaining after those through exit B**:
   - Subtract the number of students through exit B from the remaining students.
   \[
   \text{Remaining students} = 700 - 420 = 280
   \]

5. **Identify the number of students who went out through exit C**:
   - The rest of the students went out through exit C.
   \[
   \text{Number of students through exit C} = 280
   \]

So, the number of students who went out through exit C is 280."
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the problem:

John has twice as many candies as Robert, which means John has \( 2R \). We know that John has 54 candies, so we can write this as:

\[ 2R = 54 \]

To find out how many candies Robert has, we divide both sides by 2:

\[ R = \frac{54}{2} = 27 \]

Now, we know that James has 6 more candies than Robert, so James has \( R + 6 \):

\[ \text{James' candies} = 27 + 6 = 33 \]

So, James has 33 candies. To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has:

\[ \text{Difference} = \text{John's candies} - \text{James' candies} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than James."
"To solve this problem, we need to consider the number of books each person reads. Since Dolly has two books and Pandora has one book, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Books Dolly has**: Dolly starts with 2 books.
   - Books Dolly reads herself: 2 books.
   - Books Dolly reads when reading Pandora's books: 1 book (since Dolly has two books).
   - Total books Dolly reads: \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

2. **Books Pandora has**: Pandora starts with 1 book.
   - Books Pandora reads herself: 1 book.
   - Books Pandora reads when reading Dolly's books: 2 books (since Pandora has two books).
   - Total books Pandora reads: \(1 + 2 = 3\) books.

Now, add up all the books they collectively read:

- Books Dolly reads: 3 books.
- Books Pandora reads: 3 books.

Total books read by both: \(3 + 3 = 6\) books.

So, by the end, Dolly and Pandora collectively read 6 books."
"First, we need to calculate the number of letters Mike sends and receives per week. Since each person writes and receives 2 letters per week:

\[
2 \text{ letters/person/week} \times 5 \text{ people} = 10 \text{ letters/week}
\]

Next, we find out how many pages Mike writes in one week by considering that each letter is 5 pages long:

\[
10 \text{ letters/week} \times 5 \text{ pages/letter} = 50 \text{ pages/week}
\]

Now, we determine how long it takes Mike to write these 50 pages. Given that he can write 1 page every 6 minutes:

\[
50 \text{ pages} \div 6 \text{ minutes/page} = \frac{50}{6} \approx 8.33 \text{ minutes}
\]

To convert this time into hours, we divide by 60 (since there are 60 minutes in an hour):

\[
8.33 \text{ minutes} \div 60 = \frac{8.33}{60} \approx 0.139 \text{ hours}
\]

Therefore, Mike spends approximately 0.139 hours writing a week."
"To determine how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends talking daily with his boss.
2. Determine the total number of minutes spent talking during the month.
3. Subtract the total minutes used from the monthly limit.

First, let's find out how many minutes Jason talks daily with his boss. Since he makes one call every day lasting 15 minutes, the daily usage is:
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \]

Next, we calculate the total minutes used by dividing the daily usage by the number of days in the month (assuming it has exactly 30 days):
\[ 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, we add the extra 300 minutes he used beyond what was included in his plan:
\[ 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Finally, we subtract this total from the monthly limit of 1000 minutes:
\[ 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Fries**: Griffin starts with 24 fries.
2. **Kyle Takes Fries**: Kyle takes 5 fries, leaving Griffin with \(24 - 5 = 19\) fries.
3. **Billy Takes Fries**: Billy takes twice as many as Kyle, which is \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries. This leaves Griffin with \(19 - 10 = 9\) fries.
4. **Ginger Gives Fries**: Let's denote the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin as \(x\). After receiving these fries, Griffin ends up with 27 fries.
   
   Therefore, we can set up the equation based on the final count of fries:
   \[
   (9 + x) = 27
   \]
   
5. **Solving for \(x\)**:
   \[
   9 + x = 27 \\
   x = 27 - 9 \\
   x = 18
   \]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 18 fries."
"Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \( F \).

From the information given:

1. There are 4 snails in the first aquarium.
2. There are 32 snails in the second aquarium.
3. The difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums.

First, let's find the difference in the number of snails between the two aquariums:

\[ 32 - 4 = 28 \]

According to the problem statement, this difference (28) is equal to twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined:

\[ 2F = 28 \]

Now we solve for \( F \):

\[ F = \frac{28}{2} \]
\[ F = 14 \]

So, there are 14 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate how much Jean paid for the makeup services, we need to break down the costs into several parts:

1. **Cost per session**: 
   - Jeans makes up 250 hours per day.
   - Each session lasts 6 hours.
   - Cost per session = Hours per session × Rate per hour
   - Cost per session = 6 hours/session × $250/hour = $1500

2. **Total number of sessions**:
   - Sessions needed per week = Number of days per week × Number of times per week
   - Total sessions per week = 5 weekdays/week × 4 times/week = 20 sessions/week

3. **Total cost before discount**:
   - Total cost before discount = Cost per session × Total sessions per week
   - Total cost before discount = $1500/session × 20 sessions/week = $30,000

4. **Discount calculation**:
   - Discount rate = 10%
   - Amount of discount = Total cost before discount × Discount rate
   - Amount of discount = $30,000 × 0.10 = $3,000

5. **Final payment**:
   - Final payment = Total cost before discount - Amount of discount
   - Final payment = $30,000 - $3,000 = $27,000

Therefore, after applying the 10% discount due to the extensive work done on the movie, Jean paid $27,000."
"To find out how much each person paid, we need to first calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on all the party supplies:

Cake: $12
Presents: $43
Decorations: $15
Invitations: $4
Goodie Bags: $22

Total cost = Cake + Presents + Decorations + Invitations + Goodie Bags
Total cost = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
Total cost = $108

Now, since Isabelle split this cost evenly among herself and her two parents (three people), we divide the total cost by 3:

Cost per person = Total cost / Number of people
Cost per person = $108 / 3
Cost per person = $36

So, each person paid $36."
"To find out how much the chef spent on onions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of onions purchased.
2. Multiply the total weight by the price per pound to get the total cost.

**Step 1:** Calculate the total weight of onions purchased

Since there are 4 bags of onions and each bag weighs 50 pounds, the total weight is:
\[ \text{Total Weight} = 4 \times 50 = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

**Step 2:** Calculate the total cost

Given that a pound of onions costs $1.50, the total cost would be:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = 200 \times 1.50 = \$300 \]

So, the chef spent $300 on onions."
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister, we need to calculate the number of cookies each person ate on both days and then convert those quantities into calories.

**Monday's Cookies:**
- Sue: \( 4 \times 5 = 20 \) cookies
- Sister: \( 5 \) cookies

Total cookies on Monday:
\[ 20 + 5 = 25 \text{ cookies} \]

**Tuesday's Cookies:**
- Sue: \( 2 \times (5 + 13) = 2 \times 18 = 36 \) cookies
- Sister: \( 13 \) cookies

Total cookies on Tuesday:
\[ 36 + 13 = 49 \text{ cookies} \]

**Total Cookies Eaten Over Two Days:**
\[ 25 + 49 = 74 \text{ cookies} \]

**Calories Calculation:**

- Calories per cookie: 200
- Total calories for Sue:
\[ 74 \times 200 = 14800 \text{ calories} \]
- Total calories for her sister:
\[ 49 \times 200 = 9800 \text{ calories} \]

**Difference in Calories Consumed:**
\[ 14800 - 9800 = 5000 \text{ calories} \]

Thus, Sue consumed **5000 more calories** than her sister over the two days."
