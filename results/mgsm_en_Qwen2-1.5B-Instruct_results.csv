" Step-by-step Answer: The increase in the value of the house was 150% of $80,000 because this was the amount of money it increased.
To find out what 150% of $80,000 is, we multiply $80,000 by 150/100 or 3. This gives us $80,000 x 3 = $240,000.
So the value of the house increased by $240,000.
The original price of the house was $80,000 and the repairs cost $50,000, so the total cost was $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
To find the profit, we subtract the total cost from the increased value of the house: $240,000 - $130,000 = $110,000.
So Josh made a profit of $110,000. The answer is: $110000$."

" Step-by-step Answer: Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed every day.
If there are 20 chickens, then she needs to feed all the chickens a total of 3 x 20 = 60 cups of feed per day.
She gives her chickens 15 cups in the morning and 25 cups in the afternoon, which totals 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed per day.
To find out how much feed she needs for the final meal, we subtract the amount of feed already given from the total daily requirement.
So, 60 - 40 = 20 cups of feed needed for the final meal.
The answer is $\boxed{20}$."

Altogether, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 160+100=260 sheep. The answer is 260."
 Step-by-step Answer: First find the number of GB Carla downloaded before Windows interrupted her: 200 GB / 5 = 40 GB. Then subtract the amount she already downloaded from the total amount of the file to find out how many GB remain: 200 GB - 40 GB = 160 GB. Then multiply that amount by Carla's speed to find the time it took her to download that much: 160 GB / 2 GB/minute = 80 minutes. Then add the time it took her to restart the process to find the total time it took: 80 minutes + 20 minutes = 100 minutes. The answer is 100.
" Step-by-step Answer: John drove 3*60=180 miles.
He spent 2 hours idling, so he was not traveling any distance during this time.
He drove 2/2=1 hour at 30 mph, covering 30*1=30 miles.
This leaves him with 4-2-0.5=1.5 hours of travel at 80 mph.
At 80 mph, he covers 80*1.5=120 miles.
Thus, he covered a total of 180+30+120=330 miles.
Since he started out by driving 3 hours at 60 mph, he would have traveled 3*60=180 miles if he had continued straight through.
Therefore, he is 330-180=150 miles away from his starting point. The answer is 150."

" Step-by-step Answer: Carlos needs to earn back the cost of the tree by selling its fruits.
He earns $1.5 per lemon sold, and he sells 7 lemons per year, so he earns $1.5 x 7 = $10.5 per year from selling the fruit.
The annual cost to care for the tree is $3.
So his net income per year is $10.5 - $3 = $7.5.
To find out how many years it takes him to earn back the cost of the tree, we divide the cost of the tree by his annual net income.
$90 / $7.5 = 12 years.
It will take Carlos 12 years to start earning money on the lemon tree. The answer is $\boxed{12}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \(x\). According to the problem:

1. She sold a third of them at the green house, which is \(\frac{x}{3}\).
2. She sold 2 more at the red house, leaving her with \(\frac{x}{3} - 2\) vacuum cleaners.
3. She then sold half of what was left at the orange house, which is \(\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x}{3} - 2)\).

The final result is that she has 5 vacuum cleaners left. This means that the equation we need to solve is:
\[
\frac{1}{2}(\frac{x}{3} - 2) = 5
\]

Let's solve this equation step by step:

First, multiply both sides of the equation by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[
\frac{x}{3} - 2 = 10
\]

Then, add 2 to both sides to isolate \(\frac{x}{3}\):
\[
\frac{x}{3} = 12
\]

Finally, multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \(x\):
\[
x = 36
\]

So, Melanie started with 36 vacuum cleaners. The answer is $\boxed{36}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: To find out what percentage of the entire students are enrolled in hip-hop dance, we first need to calculate how many students are enrolled in contemporary and jazz dance.

20% of 20 students are enrolled in contemporary dance:
\[20\% \times 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4\]

So, 4 students are enrolled in contemporary dance.
This leaves \(20 - 4 = 16\) students.

25% of these remaining students are enrolled in jazz dance:
\[25\% \times 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4\]

So, 4 students are enrolled in jazz dance.
This leaves \(16 - 4 = 12\) students.

The remaining students, therefore, are enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[Total - (Contemporary + Jazz) = Hip-Hop\]
\[20 - (4 + 4) = 20 - 8 = 12\]
So, 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance:
\[Hip-Hop \%\ = \frac{Hip-Hop Students}{Total Students} \times 100\]
\[Hip-Hop \% = \frac{12}{20} \times 100 = 60\%\]

Therefore, 60% of the entire students are enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"Step-by-step Answer: To determine the profit, we need to calculate the difference in value between the jewelry and electronic gadgets options based on their respective increases and then subtract the cost of the electronics from the jewelry's increased value.

For the jewelry:
Increase = 2.5%

Value of Jewelry = $5,000

Increase in Value = $5,000 * 2.5/100 = $125

Profit from Jewelry = Increase in Value = $125

For the electronic gadgets:
Increase = 1.2%

Value of Electronics = $8,000

Increase in Value = $8,000 * 1.2/100 = $96

Profit from Electronics = Increase in Value = $96

Total Profit = Profit from Jewelry + Profit from Electronics = $125 + $96 = $221

Therefore, the merchant would maximize his profit by choosing the jewelry option, which results in a profit of $221."

Since there are 4 hours left, her speed needs to be 42/4=10.5 mph. The answer is 10.5."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's find out how much water is in each drink:

For the orange drink:
The amount of water in the orange drink is (2/3) * 10 liters.
So, the amount of water in the orange drink = (2/3) * 10 = 6.666...

For the pineapple drink:
The amount of water in the pineapple drink is (3/5) * 15 liters.
So, the amount of water in the pineapple drink = (3/5) * 15 = 9

Since we spilled a liter of the orange drink, we subtract this from the total amount of orange drink to get the final amount of orange drink:
Final amount of orange drink = 10 liters - 1 liter = 9 liters

Now, let's calculate the total amount of water in the remaining drink:
Total amount of water in the remaining drink = Amount of water in the orange drink + Amount of water in the pineapple drink
= 6.666... + 9
= 15.666...

Therefore, the amount of water in the remaining 24 liters is approximately 15.666 liters. Since this value cannot be expressed exactly in terms of whole numbers, we would round it down to the nearest whole number, which is 15 liters. The answer is: $15$ liters."

" Step-by-step Answer: First find the number of miles Henry traveled before his second stop by subtracting the distance of his second stop from the length of his trip: 60 miles - 15 miles = 45 miles
Then divide the distance of his first stop by the speed on average for his entire trip: 20 miles / 2 hours / 30 mph = 1/3 hour
Now multiply that time by the speed he was traveling when he first stopped: 1/3 hour * 20 mph = 20/3 miles
Finally, add the distance of this leg of his trip to the distance of the second part of his trip to find the total distance he traveled between the first and second legs: 20 miles + 20/3 miles = 40/3 miles. The answer is 40/3."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the price of the boots by B. According to the problem, we know that:

The price of the high heels is twice the price of the boots, which means it's 2B. 

We also know that the price of the high heels is $33 plus $33 (the other high heel), so we can write this relationship as an equation: 

$33 + $33 = 2B

Solving for B gives us the price of the boots. First, combine the constants on the right side of the equation:

$66 = 2B

Now divide both sides by 2 to solve for B:

B = $33

Therefore, the boots cost $33."
"Step-by-Step Answer: The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
This means that for every 7 units of age difference between them, they will add 1 unit of age to Darrell's count while subtracting 1 unit of age from Allen's count.
If their current total age is 162, we can set up an equation as follows:
(7x) + (11x) = 162,
where x represents a common multiplier.
Simplifying this equation gives us:
18x = 162,
which implies that x = 9.
Therefore, Allen's current age is 11x = 99.
To find out how old Allen will be in 10 years, we simply add 10 to his current age:
99 + 10 = 109.
So, Allen will be 109 years old in 10 years. The answer is 109."
"Step-by-step Answer: First, let's find out how many jelly beans Gunter thinks are in the jar:

The second friend said ""20 more than half the first one."" Half of 80 is 40 (since \(80 \div 2 = 40\)). Adding 20 to this gives us 60 jelly beans.

The third friend said ""25% more than the first one."" To find out what 25% of 80 is, we calculate \(80 \times 0.25 = 20\). This means the third friend thinks there are 80 + 20 = 100 jelly beans.

Now, to find the average number of jelly beans per person, we add up all the guesses and divide by the number of people:

\(80 + 60 + 100 = 240\) jelly beans in total.

There are three friends, so the average guess is \(240 \div 3 = 80\) jelly beans."
" Step-by-step Answer: John walks all 10 dogs 10*.5=5 hours a day

"Step-by-Step Answer: Let g represent the number of gold coins and s the number of silver coins. We know:

g = s + 30

And

g + s = 110

Substituting the first equation into the second gives:

(s + 30) + s = 110

Combining like terms yields:

2s + 30 = 110

Subtracting 30 from both sides gives:

2s = 80

Dividing by 2 gives:

s = 40

Now substituting this back into the first equation gives:

g = 40 + 30 = 70

So Gretchen has 70 gold coins. The answer is $\boxed{70}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: John sold the lego sets for a total of 13 x $15 = $195.
He used this money to buy 8 video games at $20 each, which came out to 8 x $20 = $160.
After buying the video games, he had $5 left, so his total spending was $195 + $160 = $355.
Since he started with $55, it means he still had $355 - $55 = $300 worth of lego sets.
Since each lego set costs $15, he must have had 300 / 15 = 20 lego sets.
The answer is $\boxed{20}$."

The answer is 10."
"Step-by-step Answer: Dana skips at 3 miles per hour, which is half the speed of her running. Therefore, she runs at a rate of \(3 \times 2 = 6\) miles per hour.

In one hour, she spends one-third of her time running and two-thirds of her time walking. Thus, in one hour, she spends \(\frac{1}{3} \times 6 + \frac{2}{3} \times 3 = 2\) hours running and \(1\) hour walking.

In \(6\) hours, she spends \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours running and \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours walking.

Since she can run at a rate of \(6\) miles per hour and she walks at a rate of \(3\) miles per hour, in \(2\) hours of running, she covers \(2 \times 6 = 12\) miles. In \(4\) hours of walking, she covers \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles.

Therefore, over the entire \(6\) hours, she travels a total distance of \(12 + 12 = 24\) miles. The answer is $\boxed{24}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: To find out how many grams of chips you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie limit, let's first calculate the total number of calories in one serving of chips and then divide by the number of servings per bag to find out how many grams fit into those servings.

Firstly, we know that:

- A bag of chips contains 250 calories per serving.
- A 300g bag contains 5 servings.

To find out how many calories are in one serving:
\[ \text{Calories per serving} = \frac{\text{Total calories}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{250}{5} = 50 \text{ calories per serving}. \]

Now, to find out how many grams (grams) fit into one serving:
\[ \text{Grams per serving} = \frac{\text{Weight of bag}}{\text{Number of servings}} = \frac{300}{5} = 60 \text{ grams per serving}. \]

Since you want to know how many grams you can eat without exceeding your daily calorie limit of 2000, you need to subtract the calories you've already consumed from the maximum amount you can consume. 

You've already consumed 1800 calories, so you're aiming to consume 2000 calories. You can eat up to:
\[ 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ grams} \] 

Therefore, if you aim to eat 200 grams without going over your calorie limit, you can eat 200 grams of chips."
" Step-by-step Answer: To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to determine his total revenue and subtract his total expenses.
First, let's calculate the number of pounds of beeswax needed for 20 candles:
\[ \text{Number of pounds} = \frac{\text{Total candles}}{\text{Candles per pound}} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \]
Next, we'll calculate the cost of making the beeswax candles:
\[ \text{Cost of materials} = 2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00 \]
Since one pound of beeswax costs $10.00, and he needs 2 pounds to make 20 candles, the cost of the beeswax itself is:
\[ \text{Cost of beeswax} = 2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00 \]
The total cost of making the candles is therefore:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$20.00 + \$20.00 = \$40.00 \]
Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 20 candles:
\[ \text{Revenue} = 20 \times \$2.00 = \$40.00 \]
Finally, we'll calculate the net profit by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:
\[ \text{Net profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Total cost} = \$40.00 - \$40.00 = \$0.00 \]
So, Charlie's net profit is $0.00 or no profit."
"Step-by-step Answer: To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we first need to determine how many articles she wrote on each day.

From the information provided:
- She wrote 5 articles on Monday.
- She wrote \(2/5\) times more articles on Tuesday than on Monday. This means she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5\).
- On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday.

Let's calculate:

Monday: \(5\) articles

Tuesday: \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles (since \(2/5\) of 5 equals 2)

Wednesday: Twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which is \(2 \times 7 = 14\) articles

Now, let's add up all the articles she wrote over the three days:

\(5 + 7 + 14 = 26\) articles

Since each article took an average of 4 hours to research and write, we multiply the number of articles by 4 to find the total time spent:

\(26 \text{ articles} \times 4 \text{ hours/article} = 104\) hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 104 hours writing articles over the three days."
" Step-by-step Answer: Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
She used 220 post-it notes for the cups of coffee.
So far, she used 80+220=300 post-it notes.

" Step-by-step Answer: John's blue ties cost $40 each, so he bought 200/40=5 sets of blue ties.
This means he bought 5*5=25 red ties.
He buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, meaning he bought 2*5=10 blue ties.
The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones, which means they cost.5*$40=$20 extra per tie.
So a red tie costs $40+$20=$60.
Thus, he spent 10*$60=$600 on red ties.
In total, he spent $200+$600=$800 on all the ties. The answer is 800."

"Step-by-step Answer: Uriah has 30 comic books x 1/4 pounds/comic book = 7.5 pounds worth of comic books.
He has a total weight of 7.5 pounds + 15 pounds = 22.5 pounds on his bag.
The toys weigh 22.5 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 15 pounds.
Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 15 pounds / 1/2 pounds/toy = 30 toys.
The answer is 30."
"Step-by-step Answer: On Thursday, the mechanic earned $60 x 6 = $360.
On Thursday, the mechanic also earned $40 x 4 = $160.
So the total amount earned on Thursday was $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, so he earned $0 from truck repairs.
He did repair 12 car tires, so he earned $40 x 12 = $480.
The total amount earned on Friday was $480.

To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, we subtract the total amount earned on Friday from the total amount earned on Thursday.
$520 - $480 = $40

Therefore, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday. The answer is 40."

" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's calculate the weight of the driver and the empty truck. We know the driver weighs 3755 pounds, and the empty truck weighs 15 pounds per box times the number of boxes (which we'll call \(n\)), plus the weight of the truck itself, which is 3755 pounds. So the equation becomes:
\[ \text{Driver} + (\text{Empty Truck}) = 3755 + 15n \]
We also know that the bridge can carry no more than 5000 pounds, so:
\[ 15n \leq 5000 \]

Now, we solve these two equations simultaneously:

First, isolate \(n\) from the second equation:
\[ n \leq \frac{5000}{15} \]
\[ n \leq 333.33... \]

Since the number of boxes must be a whole number, we take the integer part of this value, which gives us 333 boxes.

Next, substitute \(n = 333\) into the first equation to find the weight of the truck and driver:
\[ 3755 + 15(333) = 3755 + 4995 = 8750 \]

This means the truck and its contents weigh 8750 pounds, which exceeds the bridge's weight limit of 5000 pounds. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 333 boxes. 

So, the answer is $\boxed{333}$."

"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's break down this problem step by step:

1. **Total Oranges**: We start with a basket containing 25 oranges.
2. **Unripe Oranges**: 20% of these are not ripe. To find out how many unripe oranges there are, we calculate 20% of 25:
   \[
   \text{Unripe Oranges} = 20\% \times 25 = 0.20 \times 25 = 5
   \]
3. **Sour Oranges**: Out of these 5 unripe oranges, 2 are sour. This leaves us with \(5 - 2 = 3\) sour oranges.

So far, we know that there are 5 unripe oranges and 2 sour oranges. Adding them together gives us the number of unripe and sour oranges combined:
\[5 (\text{unripe}) + 2 (\text{sour}) = 7 \]

This means there are 7 unripe or sour oranges combined. Since we initially started with 25 oranges and we've accounted for 7 of those as either unripe or sour, the remaining 25 - 7 = 18 oranges must be good (since all non-sour and non-unripe oranges make up the good ones).

Therefore, the number of good oranges is 18."
" Step-by-step Answer: First find the total cost Janet paid for materials: $500 + $800 = $1300
Then multiply that amount by 10% to find out how much she pays for insurance: $1300 *.1 = $130

"Step-by-Step Answer: First calculate her pension for the first 20 years:

$50,000 \times 20 = \$1,000,000$

Then calculate the increase rate for the next 10 years:

5/100 = 0.05

For those 10 years, the additional amount is:

$50,000 \times 0.05 = \$2,500$

Adding this to her initial pension gives us:

$1,000,000 + \$2,500 = \$1,002,500$

Finally, we add this to her final pension (which she receives after 30 years):

$50,000 \times 10 = \$500,000$

So, her total annual pension after 30 years would be:

$\$1,002,500 + \$500,000 = \$1,502,500$

Therefore, Marcy's annual pension would be $1,502,500. The answer is $\boxed{1502500}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: First, we need to determine how many months are in a year. A year consists of 12 months.

Since Aleena subscribes to the streaming service monthly, the total number of months in a year is:
\[ \text{Total Months} = 12 \]

Half of this year will be \( \frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6 \) months. 

For the first six months, she pays the full amount of $140 per month.
\[ \text{Cost for the first half} = 6 \times \$140 = \$840 \]

For the second six months (the last six months), the company charges her 10% less than the original price of $140 per month. This means the reduced rate would be:
\[ \text{Reduced Rate} = \$140 - (\text{10% of } \$140) = \$140 - (\frac{10}{100} \times \$140) = \$140 - \$14 = \$126 \]

So, for these six months, she pays:
\[ \text{Cost for the second half} = 6 \times \$126 = \$756 \]

The total amount paid for the entire year is the sum of the costs for both halves:
\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$840 + \$756 = \$1596 \]

Therefore, by the end of the year, Aleena had paid a total of $1596 for the streaming service."
"Step-by-step Answer: Since Sophia needs 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank, this indicates that her car uses 1 gallon per 100 miles because \( \frac{4\text{ gallons}}{100\text{ miles}} = 0.04\text{ gallons/mile} \).

If Sophia has already driven 100 miles using 4 gallons of gas, then to find out how many miles she can drive on one full tank, we divide the distance by the rate of fuel consumption:

\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Rate}\times\text{Time} \]

Substituting the values:

\[ \text{Distance} = 0.04\text{ gallons/mile} \times 100\text{ miles} = 4\text{ miles} \]

Therefore, Sophia can drive 4 miles on a single tank of gas."

" Step-by-step Answer: For the first 180 days, the puppy needs 1 cup of dog food per day.
So, the total amount of dog food needed for this period is 180 x 1 = 180 cups.
For the remaining days (which is the rest of the year minus the first 180 days), the puppy needs 2 cups of dog food per day.
There are 365 days in a year, so the number of days remaining is 365 - 180 = 185 days.
Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed for these remaining days is 185 x 2 = 370 cups.
Adding up the amounts for both periods, the total amount of dog food needed for the entire year is 180 + 370 = 550 cups.
Since one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, the number of bags needed is 550 / 110 = 5.

" Step-by-step Answer: Freda's last batch of tomato sauce was 32 ounces, which is twice as large as a can. Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, then 32 ounces contain \( \frac{32}{3} \) cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the number of tomatoes used is \( \frac{32}{3} \times 3 \).

This simplifies to \( 32 \times 1 \), because multiplying by 3 doesn't change the value, so it remains 32.

Therefore, Freda used 32 tomatoes. The answer is $\boxed{32}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: The volume of a rectangular prism (like these boxes) is length times width times height.
The dimensions of the actual boxes are length=5"", width=6"", and height=4"".
So one box's volume is 5"" x 6"" x 4"" = 120 cubic inches.
Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume is 3 x 120 = 360 cubic inches.
However, the walls are also part of the box. They are 1"" thick on all sides.
There are 3 sides per box, so if we subtract those thicknesses from the total height of the box, we get 4-1=3 inches.
We multiply the volume of the box by 3 to account for the thickness of the walls.
So the total volume of all 3 boxes is 360 x 3 = 1080 cubic inches. The answer is 1080."

So far, he has watched 2 hours + 1.5 hours + 1.5 hours = 5 hours of shows.
If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, then he must have watched 7 hours - 5 hours = 2 hours worth of 30-minute episodes on Wednesday.
Since a 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours long, he watched 2 hours / 0.5 hours/episode = 4 episodes.
The answer is $\boxed{4}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Henry baked last year as \(x\). According to the problem, this year, he plans to bake twice as many cookies as last year, which means he plans to bake \(2x\) cookies. However, he accidentally made \(15\) more cookies than planned, meaning he actually baked \(2x + 15\) cookies.

After dropping \(5\) cookies, he ends up with \(110\) cookies. This gives us the equation:

\[2x + 15 - 5 = 110\]

Solving for \(x\):

\[2x + 10 = 110\]
\[2x = 100\]
\[x = 50\]

So, Henry baked \(50\) cookies last year."
" Step-by-step Answer: The app company gives back $.20 on every gallon of gas. If you buy 10 gallons of gas, you will get 10 *.20 = $2.00 cashback.
The gas costs $3.00 a gallon, so without any cashback, it would cost 10 * $3.00 = $30.00
Subtracting the cashback from the cost of gas, we get $30.00 - $2.00 = $28.00
The answer is $\boxed{28}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: If Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, and we know that Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.
If the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo, then we need to find out how many birds there are in Jamal's photo.
Let's denote the number of birds as B. According to the problem, the maximum number of photographs Brittany's phone can hold (which is 300) is 50 times more than the number of birds, or 300 = 50B.
To solve for B, we divide both sides by 50: B = 300/50 = 6.
So, there are 6 birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo. The answer is 6."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Sasha has ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards which cost her 10 x $10 = $100.
She also has five 4 x 4 x 10 boards which cost her 5 x $16 = $80.
In total, she has made $100 + $80 = $180.

Her profit is therefore $180 - $120 = $60. The answer is 60."
"Step-by-Step Answer: The total amount of sugar Katy used is given as 120 teaspoons. According to the ratio of sugar to water, we know that the sugar-to-water ratio is 7:13. This means that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. 

To find out how many parts of sugar are in 120 teaspoons, we divide 120 by the sum of the parts of the ratio, which is \(7 + 13 = 20\). So, \(120 \div 20 = 6\) parts of sugar.

Since the ratio represents the number of teaspoons of sugar, and 1 part equals 6 teaspoons (since \(6 \times 6 = 36\)), then 1 part of sugar equals 6 teaspoons. Therefore, 6 parts of sugar equal \(6 \times 6 = 36\) teaspoons.

So, Katy used 36 teaspoons of sugar. The answer is $\boxed{36}$."

The answer is 20.
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of queen bees as Q, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of worker bees as W. We know that:

1. Q = 2B (since there are twice as many baby bees as queens)
2. B = 2Q (since there are twice as many babies as queens)

From these equations, we can express the number of worker bees in terms of the number of queen bees:

W = 2B

We also know that the total number of bees is 700:

Q + B + W = 700

Substituting the expressions for Q and B into this equation gives us:

2B + 2B + W = 700

Combining like terms gives:

4B + W = 700

Since we already found that B = 2Q, we can substitute B in the above equation to find W:

4(2Q) + W = 700

Simplifying further gives:

8Q + W = 700

Now, we need to solve for Q and W using the information about the queen bees (Q) and the number of workers (W). Since we don't have any other direct relationship between Q and W without knowing their values, we cannot directly calculate the exact number of worker bees (W) based on the given information alone. However, if we assume that the relationships between Q, B, and W are correct, then:

The number of worker bees (W) would be equal to the number of queen bees (Q), since there are twice as many babies as queens, and similarly, there are twice as many baby bees as workers.

Therefore, the number of worker bees is simply the same as the number of queens, which is Q. Without additional information or constraints, we cannot determine the exact number of worker bees without solving for Q first."

" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote Seth's current age by \(S\) and Brooke's current age by \(B\).

From the first statement, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke. This can be written as:
\[S = 2B\]

In 2 years, Seth's age will be \(S+2\) and Brooke's age will be \(B+2\). According to the second statement, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. This can be written as:
\[(S+2) + (B+2) = 28\]

Substituting \(S=2B\) into the equation, we get:
\[2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28\]
\[3B + 4 = 28\]
\[3B = 24\]
\[B = 8\]

Now that we know Brooke's current age (\(B=8\)), we can find Seth's current age using the first equation \(S = 2B\):
\[S = 2 \times 8\]
\[S = 16\]

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The answer is $\boxed{16}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, then Sally Four must be 8 years old because Sally Forty is the same age as Sally ThirtyTwo. 

Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, meaning she is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.

Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red, meaning she is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

The total age of the four birds is \(16 + 19 + 8 + 8 = 51\) years. The answer is $\boxed{51}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: Jessica pays a minimum of $300+$200+$500=$1000 per month.

"Step-by-step Answer: First find the total time Billy spends peeling all the potatoes by multiplying the number of potatoes by the time spent on peeling: 60 potatoes * 1.5 minutes/potato = 90 minutes

Then subtract the time spent cutting the potatoes to find the time spent peeling them: 90 minutes - 30 minutes = 60 minutes

So it takes Billy 60 minutes to prepare the potatoes."
" Step-by-step Answer: Juan and Carlos sold 20 gallons of lemonade which cost them 20*3=$60 for the lemons.
They sold each glass for $.50 making their total revenue $0.50*20=$10
Their total profit was $25 so the revenue minus the cost equals profit. The cost was $60 and the revenue was $10 so the total cost was $60+$10=$70
The total cost of the lemons was $70-$25=$45

Therefore, the answer is 45."
Step-by-Step Answer: First find the total number of Asian people on the Chinese team by subtracting the number of Japanese from the total number of Asian people: 240 people - 80 people = 160 people. Then subtract the number of boys on the Chinese team to find the number of girls: 160 people - 60 people = 100 people. The answer is 100.
"Step-by-step Answer: First calculate how much Zaid spends on rent and car fuel by multiplying his monthly earnings by the fractions representing those costs:

Rent = (1 / 4) * 6000 = 1500$
Car Fuel = (1 / 3) * 6000 = 2000$

Next, subtract the amounts spent on rent and car fuel from his monthly earnings to find out how much he has left before making any charitable contributions or giving to his family:

Money Left Before Charities = 6000 - Rent - Car Fuel = 6000 - 1500 - 2000 = 2500$

After donating half of this amount to his favorite charity, he has:

Money Left After Donating = 2500 / 2 = 1250$

Then, after giving 200$ to his daughter and 700$ to his wife, he has:

Money Left After Giving = 1250 - 200 - 700 = 350$

Therefore, after all these expenses and donations, Zaid will still have $350$."
"Step-by-step Answer: If Bo has 40 crabs, and Monic has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, then Monic has \(40 - 4 = 36\) crabs.
If Rani has ten more crabs than Monic, then Rani has \(36 + 10 = 46\) crabs.
To find the total number of crabs the three have together, we add up the number of crabs each person has: \(40 + 36 + 46 = 122\).
So, the three have a total of 122 crabs together. The answer is $\boxed{122}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Lloyd earned $10 x 5 = $50 for the first week.

"Step-by-step Answer: The winner got 3/4 of the votes which totals 3/4*80 = 60 votes.
The total votes for the winner and the loser combined is 80-60= 20
If we subtract the total number of votes won by the winner from the total number of votes casted, we get the number of votes the loser got. Therefore the loser got 20-60 = -40 votes.

Therefore the loser got -40 votes. This result is not possible because votes cannot be negative. It seems there might have been a misunderstanding or a typo in the question as it stands. In reality, the winner would have received all the votes, making it impossible for the loser to receive any votes if the total votes are indeed 80. Let me know if you need further clarification!"

" Step 1: Find Jean's current age.
If we know that Mark is two years younger than Jean, then we can find Jean's current age by adding 2 to the number of years that have passed since Mark was born (which we'll call M).
So if Mark is currently X years old, then M = X - 2.
And if Jean is currently Y years old, then Y = X + 2.
We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jean's age.
Two years ago, Mark would have been X - 2 years old, and half of Jean's age would be (Y - 2) / 2.
So we can write the equation: X - 2 = (Y - 2) / 2 + 5.
Simplifying this equation gives us: X - 2 = Y/2 + 5/2.
Multiplying through by 2 gives us: 2X - 4 = Y + 5.
Now we can substitute Y = X + 2 into the equation: 2(X + 2) - 4 = X + 2 + 5.
Expanding and simplifying gives us: 2X + 4 - 4 = X + 7.
Combining like terms gives us: 2X = X + 7.
Subtracting X from both sides gives us: X = 7.
So Jean is currently 7 + 2 = 9 years old.
The answer is $\boxed{9}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: To determine the time difference between the two teams in a 4 x 400 meter relay, we need to calculate the times taken by each team's runners.
The first runner on both teams runs the first lap in 55 seconds.
For the second runner, the team with the better runners runs it in 55 - 3 = 52 seconds (since the second runner is 3 seconds faster).
Similarly, the third runner on the slower team runs it in 52 - 3 = 49 seconds.
And finally, the fourth runner on the slower team runs it in 49 - 3 = 46 seconds.
To find out which team wins, we compare their final times:
Team A finishes in 55 + 52 + 49 + 46 = 210 seconds.
Team B finishes in 55 + 52 + 49 + 46 = 210 seconds.
Therefore, the two teams finish at the same time, and no team wins over the other.
So the answer is 0 seconds."
"Step-by-Step Answer: We need to calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row.
The probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is $\frac{3}{6}=\frac{1}{2}$.
The probability of rolling two consecutive even numbers is $(\frac{2}{6})^2=\frac{4}{36}=\frac{1}{9}$.
To find the difference, we subtract the second probability from the first: $\frac{1}{2}-\frac{1}{9}=\frac{9}{18}-\frac{2}{18}=\frac{7}{18}$.
Converting this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100: $\frac{7}{18}\times100=38.89$%.
So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is approximately 38.89%. The answer is 38.89."
"Step-by-step Answer: If Jenna's mom picked 20 apples, and Jenna picked half as many apples as her mom, then Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

Together, they picked \( 20 + 10 = 30 \) apples."
"Step-by-step Answer: There are 160/6 = 26.667 rats.
Since we can't have a fraction of a rat, we round this number down to 26.
There are 26*3= 78 pieces of straw given out to the rats.
If each hamster gets 5 pieces of straw, then there must be 78/5=15.6 hamsters.
Again, since we can't have fractions of hamsters, we round this number down to 15.
So, there must be 15+20=35 pieces of straw used by all the animals.
Since there are 3 cages of rats, each rat would get 1 piece of straw.
Therefore, each cage of rats contains 26/35=0.741 rats.
Rounding this number down gives us 0."
"Step-by-step Answer: Mandy owes Benedict $100.
After one month, she will owe him an additional $100 x 0.02 = $2.
So after one month, she will owe Benedict $100 + $2 = $102.
After two months, she will owe him an additional $102 x 0.02 = $2.
So after two months, she will owe Benedict $102 + $2 = $104.
After three months, she will owe him an additional $104 x 0.02 = $2.
So after three months, she will owe Benedict $104 + $2 = $106.
Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict $106.
The answer is $\boxed{106}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \(x\). 

The cost of buying the bags would be \(20x\) dollars because the trader bought them at a rate of $20 per bag.

Transporting each bag costs $2, so transporting \(x\) bags would cost \(2x\) dollars.

The total cost including transportation is therefore \(20x + 2x = 22x\) dollars.

The trader sells the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the revenue from selling \(x\) bags is \(30x\) dollars.

After selling all the bags, the trader made a total profit of $400. Profit equals revenue minus cost, so we can write this as:

\[Revenue - Cost = \text{Profit}\]

Substituting the values we know gives us:

\[30x - (22x) = 400\]

Simplifying the equation:

\[8x = 400\]

Dividing both sides by 8:

\[x = 50\]

Therefore, the trader sold 50 bags."
Step-by-Step Answer: First find the total amount they spent on food by subtracting $4.50 from the total cost of the tickets: $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75. Then multiply that amount by 2 to find the total amount they spent on rides: $15.75 * 2 = $31.50. Then add the cost of the tickets and the cost of the rides to find the total cost: $31.50 + $20.25 = $51.75. Then divide the total cost by the number of friends to find the cost per person: $51.75 / 3 people = $17.25/person. The answer is 17.25.

" Step-by-step Answer: Tom starts with 50 trees.
He plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, so he loses 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.
After 10 years, he would lose 8 * 10 = 80 trees.
So, he would have 50 - 80 = -30 trees left.
However, it's not possible to have negative trees, so we must have made a mistake somewhere.
Let's reevaluate the problem.
Tom starts with 50 trees.
He plants 10 trees per year and chops down 2 trees per year, so he loses 10 - 2 = 8 trees per year.
After 10 years, he would lose 8 * 10 = 80 trees.
But this calculation doesn't take into account the fact that some trees may die over time.
If we assume that 30% of the trees die every year, then the number of trees remaining after 10 years would be:
(50 - 80) * (1 - 0.3) = 10 * 0.7 = 7 trees.
So, if we assume that 30% of the trees die every year, Tom would have 7 trees left.
The answer is: $7$"

"Step-by-step Answer: To find out the number of children in Soda, we need to subtract the number of men and women from the total population.

Total population = Men + Women

Substitute the given values:

Total population = 8417 (men) + 9092 (women)

Now, add these numbers together:

Total population = 8417 + 9092 = 17509

So, there are 17,509 people in Soda, including both adults and children. Since the question asks about children specifically, we don't need to divide by 2 because we're looking for a count of children.

The number of children in Soda is 17,509."
"Step-by-step Answer: Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. In the first month, she collected three times that amount, which amounts to \(20 \times 3 = 60\) cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than she did in the first month, which totals \(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.

The combined number of cards she collected in the first two months is \(20 + 60 = 80\).

In the third month, she collected twice this amount, which equals \(80 \times 2 = 160\) cards.

So, altogether, Elaine has \(20 + 60 + 40 + 160 = 300\) Pokemon cards. The answer is $\boxed{300}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: Carl ate a sandwich every day this week for lunch and used 2 slices of cheese on each sandwich. This week has 7 days, so he ate 7 sandwiches x 2 slices/sandwich = 14 slices of cheese for lunch.
He also ate cheese and egg omelets for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he used 2 slices per sandwich, he used 3 days x (2+1) slices/day = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast.
He made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. So he used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.
To find out how many slices of cheese he used in total, we add up all these amounts: 14 slices for lunch + 9 slices for breakfast + 8 slices for the macaroni and cheese = 31 slices of cheese.
So Carl used 31 slices of cheese in total. The answer is 31."
" Step-by-step Answer: Janet initially had 22 green pens + 10 yellow pens = 32 pens.
She bought 6 bags of blue pens x 9 pens per bag = 54 blue pens.

" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's find out Brinley's current average by adding up all her scores and dividing by the number of tests:

$$\frac{89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86}{5} = \frac{428}{5} = 85.6.$$

Next, we want to find out what score Brinley needs to achieve on the sixth test to bring her average up to 93. Since she wants to have a total of 93 x 6 = 558 points (since the sum of 93 multiplied by 6 equals this), we subtract her current total of 85.6 from this target total:

$$558 - 85.6 = 472.4.$$

Since Brinley cannot score a fraction of a point, we round this down to the nearest whole number. Therefore, Brinley needs to score 472 on the sixth test to have an average of 93. 

So the score she needs on the sixth test is $\boxed{472}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: First, let's calculate how many kilometers Micheal rode during the first period. Since he rides 25 kilometers each time and does this for 5 times a week, we multiply these numbers:

\[25 \, \text{km/time} \times 5 \, \text{time/week} = 125 \, \text{km/week}\]

Over four weeks, he would ride:

\[125 \, \text{km/week} \times 4 \, \text{weeks} = 500 \, \text{km}\]

Next, let's calculate how many kilometers Micheal rode during the second period. Since he rides 60 kilometers each time and does this for 2 times a week, we multiply these numbers:

\[60 \, \text{km/time} \times 2 \, \text{time/week} = 120 \, \text{km/week}\]

Over three weeks, he would ride:

\[120 \, \text{km/week} \times 3 \, \text{weeks} = 360 \, \text{km}\]

Finally, we add up the kilometers from both periods to find the total distance Micheal rode over the six-week period:

\[500 \, \text{km} + 360 \, \text{km} = 860 \, \text{km}\]

Therefore, Micheal rode a total of 860 kilometers over the six-week period."
"Step-by-step Answer: Each chocolate bar weighs 40 g, which is equivalent to 0.4 kg. Therefore, each candied apple weighs 0.4/2 = 0.2 kg.
There are 25 chocolate bars in Joe's bag, so the weight of the chocolate bars is 25*0.4 = 10 kg.
There are 80 candied apples in Joe's bag, so the weight of the candied apples is 80*0.2 = 16 kg.
Therefore, the total weight of Joe's bag of candy is 10+16 = 26 kg. The answer is 26."
"Step-by-step Answer: Rose bought 4 cakes on Monday.

On Wednesday, she bought 5 times the number of cakes she bought on Tuesday, which is \(5 \times 12 = 60\) cakes.
To find out how many cakes she bought after all three days, we add up the number of cakes she bought each day: \(4 + 12 + 60 = 76\).
So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days. The answer is $\boxed{76}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: A dozen consists of 12 items, so twenty dozen is equal to 20*12 = 240 cups.
The total cost of the plates is $6000/2= $3000.
If 2 dozen plates cost $3000, then one dozen plates cost $3000/12=$250.
Thus, one cup costs $250-$1200=$-950.
Since it's not possible to buy a negative number of cups, this means all the cups are free. The answer is 0."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's calculate how much Sara needs to earn from babysitting. She needs to earn $30 (for the jacket) plus 2*$20 (for the 2 pairs of shoes) which equals $30+$40=$70.

Next, we need to figure out how much money Sara will make from babysitting. She earns $5 each time she babysits, and she plans to babysit 4 times, so she will earn $5*4=$20.

After subtracting the amount Sara earned from babysitting from the total amount she needs, we get $70-$20=$50. This means she needs to earn an additional $50 from mowing lawns.

Finally, to find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per lawn mowing ($4). So, $50/$4=$12.5

Since you cannot count half a lawn mowing, Sara needs to mow the lawn 13 times. The answer is 13."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. We know that:

1. The total number of chickens is 2R+W (since there are two more white chickens than red ones).
2. The total number of eggs collected per day is 42.
3. The production rate of red chickens is 3 eggs/day and the production rate of white chickens is 5 eggs/day.

We also know that the sum of their daily egg production equals the total number of eggs collected, which gives us another equation:
\[3R + 5W = 42\]

Since we're given that there are two more white chickens than red ones, we can express one variable in terms of the other. Let's say the number of red chickens is \(R\) and the number of white chickens is \(R + 2\). Substituting these into our equations allows us to solve for \(R\).

First, let's substitute \(R\) in the second equation:
\[3(R) + 5((R + 2)) = 42\]
\[3R + 5R + 10 = 42\]
\[8R + 10 = 42\]
\[8R = 42 - 10\]
\[8R = 32\]
\[R = \frac{32}{8}\]
\[R = 4\]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."

" Step-by-step Answer: Let x represent the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
Then the big pool had 2x gallons.
Now the big pool has 4*(x+4) = 4x+16 gallons.
Since the big and small pool leak at a rate of 4 gallons/minute, we can set up an equation:
2x - (x+4) = 4x + 16 - 4(4)
Solving this gives:
2x - x - 4 = 4x + 16 - 16
-x = 4x
-x - 4x = -16
-5x = -16
x = 16 / -5 = -3.2
So the small pool has -3.2 gallons of water now.

Therefore, the answer is -3.2."

" Step-by-step Answer: Naomi scored 68 points.
Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi, which is (68/2) + 10 = 44 points.
Brianna scored 17 points more than Naomi, which is 68 + 17 = 85 points.
The total points scored by all four students is 68 + 44 + 85 + Jojo's score = 207 + Jojo's score.
We know that the total points scored by all four students is 251, so we can set up the equation 207 + Jojo's score = 251.
To find Jojo's score, we subtract 207 from both sides of the equation: Jojo's score = 251 - 207 = 44.
So, Jojo scored 44 points. The answer is $\boxed{44}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: First calculate the amount Carlos pays by multiplying the number of hours he rents the canoe by the price per hour: 3 hours * $30/hour = $90.
Then multiply the number of hours Benji rents the raft by the price per hour: 5 hours * $18/hour = $90.
Finally, add the amounts together to find the total cost: $90 + $90 = $180.
The answer is 180."
"Step-by-step Answer: If it takes 6 days to travel by bus, then it takes 6/2 = 3 days to travel by car.

"Step-by-step Answer: James starts with 30 fire type cards, 20 grass type cards, and 40 water type cards. This gives him a total of \(30+20+40=90\) cards.
If he loses 8 of the water type, he will have \(40-8=32\) water type cards remaining.
If he then buys 14 more grass type cards, he will have a total of \(32+14=46\) cards.
The probability of drawing a water type card randomly is therefore \(\frac{32}{46}\).
To convert this fraction to a percentage, we multiply by 100:
\[\frac{32}{46} \times 100 = 69.23076923...\]
Rounded to the nearest integer, this is approximately 69%. The answer is 69."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's break down the costs:

1. Base Burrito: $6.50
2. Extra Meat: $2.00
3. Extra Cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. Salsa/Sauce (2): $0.25 x 2 = $0.50

Now let's calculate the total cost before the upgrade:
$6.50 (base) + $2.00 (extra meat) + $1.00 (extra cheese) + $1.00 (avocado) + $0.50 (sauces) = $11.00

Then we add the upgrade charge ($3.00):
$11.00 (total cost without upgrade) + $3.00 (upgrade) = $14.00

Finally, Chad uses a gift card for $5.00:
$14.00 (after upgrade) - $5.00 (gift card) = $9.00

So Chad still owes $9.00."
" Step-by-step Answer: Kalinda places 4 pieces per minute, while her mother places half as many which is 4/2=2 pieces per minute.
Together, they place 4+2=6 pieces per minute.
The puzzle consists of 360 pieces, so it will take 360/6=60 minutes to finish the puzzle.
Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, it will take 60/60=1 hour to finish the puzzle. The answer is 1."
"Step-by-step Answer: Ashlyn was able to take home 120*0.30 = 36 baby watermelons.
This leaves a total of 120-36 = 84 baby watermelons on the farm.

"Step-by-Step Answer: If there were 50 ants, then the number of bugs was half as many as ants, which makes it 50/2= 25.
The total number of insects in the garden would be 25+50= 75. The answer is 75."
" Step-by-step Answer: If there are 36 penguins, then one-third of them would be \(36 \times \frac{1}{3} = 12\) penguins.
If another one-third of them go inside the cave to eat their dinner, then it would be \(36 \times \frac{1}{3} = 12\) penguins as well.
So, the total number of penguins that went inside or into the cave is \(12 + 12 = 24\).
Therefore, the number of penguins still left sunbathing is \(36 - 24 = 12\). The answer is 12."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Steve's girlfriend eats half as much as him which means she eats 6 / 2 = 3 tomatoes per day.
Combined they eat 6 + 3 = 9 tomatoes per day
This means they produce 3 * 4 = 12 tomatoes per week
So he needs 12/3 = 4 vines per week

Therefore, the answer is 4."
"Step-by-Step Answer: John needs to divide 20*4=80 slices among his friends.

" Step-by-step Answer: Ram starts with 25 pens.
Each pen makes him 1/5 of a new pen because he mixes 5 empty pens into 1 to create 1 full pen.
So, for every pen, he gets 1/5 of a new pen.
Therefore, for 25 pens, he gets 25 * (1/5) = 5 new pens.
Adding this to the original 25 pens, he ends up with 25 + 5 = 30 pens in total.
The answer is $\boxed{30}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: Johnny initially had $20.
He added an extra $10, so he had a total of $20 + $10 = $30.
This amount of money tripped three times as much, so he had $30 * 3 = $90 after a year.
The answer is $\boxed{90}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, we know that Jessa is 20 years old.
Joan is 5 years older than Jessa, so Joan's age is 20 + 5 = 25 years old.
And Mary is 2 years younger than Joan, so Mary's age is 25 - 2 = 23 years old.
To find the sum of their ages, we add up their individual ages: 20 + 25 + 23 = 68 years.
The answer is $\boxed{68}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: Exit A saw 30% of the initial number of students leaving, which is 30/100*1000 = 300 students.
There were thus 1000-300= 700 students remaining.
Exit B saw 3/5 of the remaining students leaving, which is (3/5)*700 = 420 students.
This leaves 700-420= 280 students going out through exit C. The answer is 280."
"Step-by-Step Answer: If John has twice as many candies as Robert, and we know that John has 54 candies, then Robert must have 54/2=27 candies.
If James has 6 more candies than Robert, and we know that Robert has 27 candies, then James has 27+6=33 candies.
To find out how many more candies John has than James, we subtract the number of candies James has from the number of candies John has: 54-33=21.
The answer is $\boxed{21}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Dolly reads 2+1=3 books.

" Step-by-step Answer: Mike had 5 friends who became pen pals and then he lost contact with 2, leaving him with 3 friends.
Each friend sends 2 letters per week, and since each letter is 5 pages long, this means each friend writes 2*5=10 pages per week.
So in total, Mike's friends write 10*3=30 pages per week.
Since Mike can write one page every 6 minutes, he spends 6/10=0.6 minutes on each page.
Thus, it would take him 0.6*30=18 minutes to write all the letters.
As there are 60 minutes in an hour, this equates to 18/60=0.3 hours.
The answer is $\boxed{0.3}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: Jason has called his boss 300 minutes because 15 x 2 = 300
He has used 300 minutes on calls with other people and has a monthly quota of 1000 minutes.
He has already used up 300 out of his 1000 minutes which leaves him with 1000 - 300 = 700 minutes.

" Step-by-step Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, Griffin had 24 french fries.
2. Kyle took 5 of them, leaving Griffin with \(24 - 5 = 19\) french fries.
3. Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which means Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) french fries.
4. After Billy took his share, Griffin was left with \(19 - 10 = 9\) french fries.
5. Ginger gave Griffin a handful of her fries, let's call this amount \(x\).
6. Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took, which means Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) french fries.
7. In the end, Griffin had 27 french fries, so we can set up an equation:
   \[9 + x + (2 + x) = 27.\]
8. Simplifying the equation gives us:
   \[9 + 2x + x = 27,\]
   or
   \[3x + 9 = 27.\]
9. Subtracting 9 from both sides gives us:
   \[3x = 18.\]
10. Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
   \[x = 6.\]
11. Therefore, Ginger gave Griffin 6 french fries. The answer is $\boxed{6}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies. On Monday, Sue ate 4 times this amount which equals 4*5=20 cookies.
On Tuesday, Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Monday, which equals 2*5=10 cookies.
In total, Sue consumed 20+10=30 cookies over the two days.
Her sister ate a total of 5+13=18 cookies over the two days.
This means Sue consumed 30-18=12 more cookies than her sister.
If we know one cookie contains 200 calories, then Sue consumed an additional 12*200=2400 calories.
The answer is 2400."
