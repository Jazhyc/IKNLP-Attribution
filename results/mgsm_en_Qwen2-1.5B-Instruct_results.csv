" Step-by-step Answer: Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs per day.
She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 eggs remaining.
She bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she has 13 - 4 = 9 eggs left.
She sells the remaining eggs at $2 per dozen (12 eggs), so she makes 9 / 12 * $2 = $1.50 every day.
The answer is $\boxed{1.5}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: Josh's house was initially worth $80,000.
He spent $50,000 on repairs, which increased the value of the house by 150%.
This means the increase in value is 150/100 * $80,000 = $120,000.
So the new value of the house is $80,000 + $120,000 = $200,000.
The profit he made is the final value of the house minus the initial purchase price, so it is $200,000 - $80,000 = $120,000.
The answer is $\boxed{120000}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: Wendi feeds each chicken 3 cups of feed every day.
If she has a flock of 20 chickens, then she needs to divide the total amount of feed by the number of chickens to find out how much feed each chicken gets per day.
So, 3 cups of feed / 20 chickens = 0.15 cups of feed per chicken per day.
Wendi gives her chickens 15 cups of feed in the morning and 25 cups of feed in the afternoon, which totals 15 + 25 = 40 cups of feed.
To find out how much feed she needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we subtract the amount of feed given in the morning and afternoon from the total amount of feed needed per day.
So, 0.15 cups of feed per chicken per day x 20 chickens = 3 cups of feed.
Therefore, Wendi needs to give her chickens 3 cups of feed in the final meal of the day. The answer is 3."
"Step-by-step Answer: Kylar needs to buy 16 glasses. Every second one costs 60/100 * 5 = $3 less than a normal one.
So, the second ones cost 5 - 3 = $2 each.
The first 8 glasses will cost him 8 * 5 = $40.
The next 8 glasses will cost him 8 * 2 = $16.
In total, Kylar needs to pay 40 + 16 = $56 for all the glasses. The answer is 56."
"Step-by-step Answer: If Seattle has 20 sheep, then Charleston has 4*20=80 sheep.
Together, Charleston and Seattle have 80+20=100 sheep.
Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, Toulouse has 2*80=160 sheep.
Combined, Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle have 160+100=260 sheep. The answer is 260."
 Step-by-step Answer: First find the number of GB downloaded before Windows interrupted: 200 GB / 5 = 40 GB. Then multiply that amount by 40% to find out how many GB are taken up by the Windows interruption: 40 GB * .4 = 16 GB. Then add the size of the initial file to subtract the size of the interruption to find the final size: 200 GB + 16 GB - 20 GB = 196 GB. The answer is 196.
" Step-by-step Answer: John drives for 3 hours at a speed of 60 mph, so he covers a distance of 3*60=180 miles.
He then turns around and drives back home, which takes him another 2 hours at a speed of 60 mph, covering an additional 2*60=120 miles.
So far, he has covered a total of 180+120=300 miles.
He then spends the next half-hour driving at a speed of 30 mph, covering a distance of 0.5*30=15 miles.
After this, he drives the remaining 2 hours at a speed of 80 mph, covering a distance of 2*80=160 miles.
In total, he has driven 300+15+160=475 miles.
Since he was initially 300 miles away from home, he is now 475-300=175 miles away from home at the end of those 4 hours. The answer is 175."
"Step-by-step Answer: Eliza's regular rate is $10/hour. Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2*10 = $12/hour.
She worked for a total of 45 hours this week. Of these, 40 hours are at her regular rate, and 5 hours are at her overtime rate.
Her earnings for the first 40 hours are 40*$10 = $400
Her earnings for the next 5 hours are 5*$12 = $60
Her total earnings for the week are $400+$60 = $460. The answer is 460."

"Step-by-step Answer: First, let's calculate the cost of each type of pastry:

- Donuts: 3 dozen at $68 per dozen.
  \(3 \times 68 = \$194\)

- Mini Cupcakes: 2 dozen at $80 per dozen.
  \(2 \times 80 = \$160\)

- Mini Cheesecakes: 6 dozen at $55 per dozen.
  \(6 \times 55 = \$330\)

Now, we add up the costs of all the pastries:
\(194 + 160 + 330 = \$684\)

Therefore, the total cost of all the pastries is $684."
" Step-by-step Answer: Carlos needs to earn $90 to pay for the tree.

" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \(V\).

From the information given:

1. She sold a third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which means she sold \(\frac{1}{3}V\) vacuum cleaners.
2. She then sold 2 more to the red house, making it \(\frac{1}{3}V + 2\) vacuum cleaners.
3. From this point, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, meaning she sold \(\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{3}V + 2\right)\) vacuum cleaners at the orange house.
4. This remaining amount equals 5 vacuum cleaners, so we set up the equation:
   \[\frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{3}V + 2\right) = 5.\]

Solving this equation will give us the value of \(V\), the initial number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with.

First, simplify the equation:
\[ \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{1}{3}V + 2\right) = 5 \]
Multiply both sides by 2 to get rid of the fraction:
\[ \frac{1}{3}V + 2 = 10 \]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ \frac{1}{3}V = 8 \]
Multiply both sides by 3 to solve for \(V\):
\[ V = 8 \times 3 \]
\[ V = 24 \]

So, Melanie started with 24 vacuum cleaners."
"Step-by-Step Answer: First, calculate the number of students who enrolled in contemporary dance:

\[20\% \text{ of } 20 = 0.20 \times 20 = 4\]

So, 4 students enrolled in contemporary dance.

Then, subtract this number from the total number of students:

\[20 - 4 = 16\]

This leaves 16 students who didn't enroll in contemporary dance.

Next, calculate the number of students who enrolled in jazz dance:

\[25\% \text{ of } 16 = 0.25 \times 16 = 4\]

So, 4 students enrolled in jazz dance.

Finally, subtract the number of students who enrolled in both contemporary and jazz dances (which we just calculated) from the remaining students to find out how many are enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[16 - 4 = 12\]

Therefore, 12 students are enrolled in hip-hop dance.

To find the percentage of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance:

\[12 \div 20 = 0.60\]

Multiply by 100 to convert it into a percentage:

\[0.60 \times 100 = 60\%\]

The answer is 60%."
"To determine the maximum profit the merchant could earn by choosing one option over the other, we need to calculate the difference in profit between the two options based on their respective price increases.

For the jewelry:
Price increase = 2.5%
New price = Original price + (Original price \* Price increase)
New price = $5,000 + ($5,000 \* 2.5/100) = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

Profit from jewelry = New price - Original price = $5,125 - $5,000 = $125

For the electronics:
Price increase = 1.2%
New price = Original price + (Original price \* Price increase)
New price = $8,000 + ($8,000 \* 1.2/100) = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Profit from electronics = New price - Original price = $8,096 - $8,000 = $96

Comparing the profits:
Jewelry profit = $125
Electronics profit = $96

The merchant would choose the jewelry option if the jewelry's profit is greater than the electronics' profit. Since $125 > $96, the merchant would choose the jewelry option to maximize profit. Therefore, the maximum profit the merchant could earn is $125."
"Step-by-step Answer: In the first day, the two trains traveled a combined distance of 80 miles each. Therefore, the total distance covered by both trains on the first day was \(80 \times 2 = 160\) miles.

On the second day, each train traveled an additional 150 miles. Since there are two trains, the total distance covered by both trains on the second day was \(150 \times 2 = 300\) miles.

Therefore, the total distance covered by each train over the two days was \(160 + 300 = 460\) miles."
" Step-by-step Answer: Jill earns $20 x 50 = $1000 per month as a teacher.
She earns $30 x 15 = $450 per month as a coach.

Therefore, her annual salary is $1450 x 12 = $17400. The answer is 17400."
" Step-by-step Answer: Claire eats 3 eggs per day.
There are 7 days in a week, so in one week she eats 3 x 7 = 21 eggs.
In four weeks, she would eat 21 x 4 = 84 eggs.
Since there are 12 eggs in a dozen, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to find out how many dozens she eats.
So, Claire eats 84 / 12 = 7 dozens of eggs in four weeks. The answer is $\boxed{7}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Marissa walked 4+2=6 miles in the first 2 hours.
She has 12-6=6 miles left to walk.

"Step-by-Step Answer: First, let's find out how much water is in the original orange drink. Since the orange drink is two-thirds water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in orange drink} = \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Next, let's find out how much water is in the pineapple drink. Since the pineapple drink is three-fifths water, we calculate:

\[ \text{Water in pineapple drink} = \frac{3}{5} \times 15 = 9 \text{ liters} \]

When you pour the orange drink into the pineapple drink, you spill one liter of the orange drink. This means you're actually adding \(10 - 1 = 9\) liters of the orange drink to the pineapple drink.

The total amount of water in the new mixture will be the sum of the water from both drinks before spilling (orange drink) plus the water from the spilled orange drink (which was equal to the amount of water in the orange drink before spilling), minus the water from the pineapple drink that was added (the same as the water in the pineapple drink).

So, the total water in the new mixture is:

\[ 6.67 + 9 - 9 = 6.67 \text{ liters} \]

Therefore, there are approximately 6.67 liters of water in the remaining 24 liters of the mixed drink."
" Step-by-step Answer: Samantha is currently 31 years old.
If Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha, then Raymond is currently 31+6 = 37 years old.
If Raymond had a son at the age of 23, then the difference in their ages is 37-23 = 14 years.
Since the son was born when Raymond was 23, we need to find out how many years ago the son was born.
To do this, we subtract the age of the son from the current age of Raymond, which gives us 23-14 = 9 years ago.
The answer is $\boxed{9}$."

"Step-by-Step Answer: The discounted price is $19.50 which is 75% of the original price because it's 25% less than the original price. Let's denote the original price as x. Therefore, we can write the equation:

0.75x = $19.50

To find the original price (x), divide both sides by 0.75:

x = $19.50 / 0.75

x = $26

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"Step-by-step Answer: First find the total cost of the milk by multiplying the number of packs by the price per pack: 5 packs * $3/pack = $15
Then find the total cost of the apples by multiplying the number of apples by the price per apple: 4 apples * $1.50/apple = $6
Now add up all the prices of the chicken meal, milk, apples, and pizza to find the total cost of everything except the boxes of pizza: $12 + $15 + $6 + x(boxes) = $50 where x is the number of boxes of pizza.
Now multiply the number of boxes by the price per box to find the total cost of the boxes of pizza: 8.5x = $50 - ($12 + $15 + $6)
Now divide both sides by 8.5 to solve for x: x = (($50 - ($12 + $15 + $6)) / 8.5) = 2 boxes of pizza. The answer is 2."
 Step-by-step Answer: First find the total cost of the shorts: $16.50/short * 3 shorts = $50.50 Next find the total cost of the pants: $22.50/pant * 3 pants = $67.50 Add those two amounts to find the total cost of the clothes: $50.50 + $67.50 + $42 = $150. The answer is 150.
" Step-by-step Answer: Cynthia eats one serving of ice cream every night for 60 days, so she will eat 60 servings of ice cream.
Each carton contains 15 servings, so she needs to buy 60/15 = 4 cartons of ice cream.
Each carton costs $4.00, so she will spend 4 x $4.00 = $16.00 on ice cream.
The answer is $\boxed{16}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: Henry traveled 20+15=35 miles between his first and second stops.
The answer is 35."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the price of the boots as \(B\). According to the problem, the second pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, which costs $33. Therefore, the second pair of high heels costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

The total cost of the high heels is given by the sum of the prices of both pairs, which equals $33 + 66 = 99$ dollars.

Given that the total cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the boots, we can set up an equation:

\[B + 99 = B - 5\]

Solving this equation will give us the price of the boots (\(B\)).

Subtracting \(B\) from both sides gives:

\[99 = -5\]

This equation is not correct because it implies that the total cost of the high heels (which is $99) is equal to the negative of the price of the boots minus five dollars. This suggests there might be a misunderstanding or a typo in the interpretation of the question.

However, if we assume the question meant that the total cost of the high heels is five dollars less than the boots, then we would proceed as follows:

\[B + 99 = B - 5\]

Adding \(B\) to both sides gives:

\[99 + 5 = B\]

So, the boots cost $104.

Therefore, the boots cost $104."
"Step-by-Step Answer: The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is 7:11.
This means that if we let x represent the common multiplier, then Darrell's age is 7x and Allen's age is 11x.
The sum of their ages is given as 162, so we have the equation 7x + 11x = 162.
Combining like terms gives us 18x = 162.
Dividing both sides by 18 gives us x = 9.
Therefore, Allen's current age is 11x = 11(9) = 99.
To find Allen's age 10 years from now, we simply add 10 to his current age: 99 + 10 = 109.
So, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now. The answer is $\boxed{109}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: The second friend's guess is 80/2+20=40.

"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's denote the number of silver coins as \(S\) and the number of gold coins as \(G\). We know that:

1. \(G = S + 30\)
2. \(S + G = 110\)

We can substitute the first equation into the second one to solve for \(S\):

\(S + (S + 30) = 110\)

Combine like terms:

\(2S + 30 = 110\)

Subtract 30 from both sides:

\(2S = 80\)

Divide by 2:

\(S = 40\)

Now we know there are 40 silver coins. Using the first equation:

\(G = S + 30 = 40 + 30 = 70\)

So, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Half of Raymond's jewels is 40/2 = 20.

" Step-by-step Answer: In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.
In the second 20 minutes, he scored 25% more points than the first 20 minutes. This means he scored an additional 4 * 0.25 = 1 point in the second 20 minutes.
So in the second 20 minutes, he scored a total of 4 + 1 = 5 points.
To find the total number of points he scored, we add the points from the first 20 minutes and the second 20 minutes together. This gives us 4 + 5 = 9 points.
The answer is $\boxed{9}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, so over 30 days he will eat 2*30 = 60 yogurts.
They are currently on sale at 4 yogurts for $5.00, so each yogurt costs $5/4 = $1.25.
To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we multiply the number of yogurts by the price per yogurt: 60*$1.25 = $75.
The answer is $\boxed{75}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: John runs 3/2=1.5 hours on the other two days.
So he runs 3+1.5=4.5 hours a week.
That means he runs 60/4.5=13.333 mph per hour. The answer is 13.333."
"Step-by-step Answer: Dana's skipping speed is half her running speed, which means her running speed is twice her skipping speed. Since she skips at 3 mph, her running speed is \(3 \times 2 = 6\) mph. In six hours, she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking. 

The time spent running is \(6 \times \frac{1}{3} = 2\) hours.
The time spent walking is \(6 \times \frac{2}{3} = 4\) hours.

In 2 hours of running, she covers \(2 \times 6 = 12\) miles (since her running speed is 6 mph).
In 4 hours of walking, she covers \(4 \times 3 = 12\) miles (since her walking speed is 3 mph).

Therefore, in six hours, she travels a total of \(12 + 12 = 24\) miles. The answer is $\boxed{24}$."

"Step-by-Step Answer: A 300g bag has 5 servings, meaning each serving is 300/5 = 60 grams.
If a serving has 250 calories, then 60 grams will have 60*250 = 15000 calories.
Since your daily calorie target is 2000, eating 15000 calories exceeds your daily calorie target by 15000-2000 = 13000 calories.
Therefore, if you have already consumed 1800 calories, you can still consume 13000-1800 = 11200 calories before exceeding your daily calorie target. The answer is 11200."
" Step-by-step Answer: To find out Charlie's net profit, we first need to calculate his total expenses and then subtract them from his total revenue.

First, let's figure out how much it costs him to make one pound of beeswax:

One pound of beeswax yields 10 candles, and each candle requires a wick costing $10.00 in supplies. Therefore, the cost of making one pound of beeswax is $10.00 (for the wick) plus $10.00 (for the beeswax), which equals $20.00 per pound.

Next, we'll determine how much he earns from selling all 20 candles:

He sells each candle for $2.00, so for 20 candles, he would earn 20 * $2.00 = $40.00.

Now, to find his net profit, we subtract the total cost from the total earnings:

Total earnings = Selling price per candle * Number of candles sold
Total earnings = $2.00/candle * 20 candles = $40.00

Total cost = Cost per pound of beeswax * Weight of beeswax used
Total cost = $20.00/pound * 1 pound = $20.00

Net profit = Total earnings - Total cost
Net profit = $40.00 - $20.00 = $20.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from selling 20 candles is $20.00."
"Step-by-step Answer: On Monday, Meredith wrote 5 articles which took her 5 * 4 = 20 hours.
On Tuesday, she wrote 2/5*5 = 2 more articles than on Monday.
This means she wrote 5+2 = 7 articles on Tuesday.
The total time taken to write these articles was 7 * 4 = 28 hours.
On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, meaning she wrote 2*7 = 14 articles.
The total time taken to write all the articles on Wednesday was 14 * 4 = 56 hours.
In total, Meredith spent 20 + 28 + 56 = 104 hours writing articles last week. The answer is 104."
" Step-by-step Answer: Candice initially had 80 post-it notes.
She then purchased a package of post-it notes containing 23 additional notes.
So, the total number of post-it notes she had was 80 + 23 = 103.
At work, she placed a single post-it note on each of 220 different cups of coffee.
This means she used 220 post-it notes.
To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that she purchased, we subtract the number of post-it notes she used from the total number of post-it notes she had.
So, the number of post-it notes in the package is 103 - 220 = -117.
However, this result doesn't make sense because it's negative.
It seems there might have been a misunderstanding in the question or the problem statement.
Let's re-examine the problem.
If Candice initially had 80 post-it notes and then purchased another 23, she would have a total of 80 + 23 = 103 post-it notes.
But if she used all these post-it notes on the 220 cups of coffee, she would have 103 - 220 = -117 post-it notes left.
This result doesn't make sense either because it's negative.
The mistake here is that Candice didn't use all the post-it notes she had on the 220 cups of coffee.
Instead, let's assume that she used some of the post-it notes on the 220 cups of coffee and kept some for herself.
If she used x post-it notes on the 220 cups of coffee, then she would have 103 - x post-it notes left.
We know that she also had 23 post-it notes remaining overall, so we can set up an equation:
\[103 - x = 23\]
Solving for x gives us:
\[x = 103 - 23 = 80\]
Therefore, Candice used 80 post-it notes on the 220 cups of coffee and kept 23 post-it notes for herself.
To find out how many post-it notes were in the package that she purchased, we add the number of post-it notes she used to the number of post-it notes she kept for herself:
\[80 + 23 = 103\]
So, Candice purchased a package of 103 post-it notes. The answer is: $103$"
" Step-by-step Answer: John bought 2 blue ties because it says ""John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties"" and we know he spent $200 on blue ties which cost $40 each so 2*$40=$80 on blue ties.
He spent $120 on red ties because 2*$200=$400 and .5*40=$20 increase in price per tie.

"Step-by-step Answer: On Thursday, the mechanic earned 6*60=$360 on truck tires.
He also earned 4*40=$160 on car tires.
So on Thursday, the mechanic earned a total of 360+160=$520.
On Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, but he earned 12*40=$480 on car tires.
Thus, on Friday, the mechanic earned a total of 480+$0=480.
Therefore, the difference between the two days was 520-480=$40.
The answer is 40."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Let's denote the number of kittens adopted by Patchy as \(P\) and the number of kittens adopted by Trixie as \(T\). According to the problem:

1. \(P = 3 \times T\)
2. \(P + T = 7\)

We need to find out how many kittens the family has now, which includes both the original 7 kittens and the new ones born from the adopted cats.

First, let's express \(T\) in terms of \(P\) using equation (1):

\[T = \frac{P}{3}\]

Substituting this into equation (2) gives us:

\[P + \frac{P}{3} = 7\]

Multiplying every term by 3 to clear the fraction gives:

\[3P + P = 21\]

Combining like terms yields:

\[4P = 21\]

Dividing both sides by 4 gives:

\[P = \frac{21}{4}\]

So, Patchy has \(P = \frac{21}{4}\) or approximately 5.25 kittens. Since we cannot have a fraction of a kitten, we round down to the nearest whole number, meaning Patchy has 5 kittens.

Now, substituting \(P = 5\) back into equation (1) gives us:

\[5 = 3T\]

Solving for \(T\) gives:

\[T = \frac{5}{3}\]

Again, rounding down since we cannot have a fraction of a kitten, we get:

\[T = 1\] kitten

Therefore, Trixie also has 1 kitten.

Adding the original 7 kittens to the 2 adopted kittens (from Patchy and Trixie), the family now has \(7 + 1 + 1 = 9\) kittens."

"Step-by-step Answer: First, we need to find out the total weight of the driver and the empty truck. This is given as 3755 pounds. 

The weight of one box is 15 pounds. Therefore, the total weight of all the boxes (which equals the weight of the truck) is \(3755 \div 15 = 253\) boxes.

However, this calculation assumes that every box fits on the truck without any extra space. But since the bridge can only carry a maximum of 5000 pounds, and the truck already exceeds this limit by carrying 3755 pounds, it means that the truck cannot fit any more boxes because it would exceed the bridge's weight limit.

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is \(0\)."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, we need to calculate the amount of the delivery fee. This is 25% of the final bill, which is $40.00.
To find the delivery fee, we multiply $40 by 25% (or 0.25): $40 * 0.25 = $10.00.
So the total cost of the delivery is $10.00.
Next, we add the delivery fee to the original bill to get the new total.
The new total is $40 + $10 = $50.00.
Finally, we add the $4.00 tip to the new total to get the final price of Stephen's groceries.
The final price is $50 + $4 = $54.00.
The answer is $\boxed{54}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: Janet paid $500 for the material and $800 for the jeweler, so the total cost before insurance was $500 + $800 = $1300.
She then pays 10% of that amount to get it insured, which is 10/100 * $1300 = $130.
So the total amount she paid is $1300 + $130 = $1430.
The answer is $\boxed{1430}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Marcy's initial pension is $50,000/year for the first 20 years. So, her total pension for those 20 years is:

\[20 \times \$50,000 = \$1,000,000\]

Starting after 20 years, she starts receiving a 5% increase on her pension every subsequent year until she retires at age 40. This means she receives an additional 5% of her current pension each year for the remaining 10 years (from age 20 to 30).

The formula for calculating the future value of an annuity due to compound interest is:

\[A = P(1 + r)^n\]

Where:
- \(A\) is the amount of money accumulated after n years,
- \(P\) is the principal amount (the initial investment),
- \(r\) is the annual interest rate, and
- \(n\) is the number of compounding periods.

For the first 20 years, we calculate the total amount as follows:

\[Total_{first_20} = \$1,000,000\]

For the next 10 years, starting from age 20, she receives an additional 5% of her current pension each year. Let's denote her current pension as \(P_{current}\). Her new pension after 20 years would then be \(P_{new} = P_{current} + 0.05(P_{current}) = 1.05P_{current}\).

So, the equation for the total amount after 30 years is:

\[Total_{total} = Total_{first_20} + 10 \times 1.05P_{current}\]

Substituting the values we know:

\[Total_{total} = \$1,000,000 + 10 \times 1.05(\$1,000,000) = \$1,000,000 + 10 \times \$1,050,000 = \$1,000,000 + \$1,050,000 = \$2,050,000\]

Now, let's find out how much she gets annually after 20 years:

\[Annual_{after_20} = \frac{Total_{total}}{20} = \frac{\$2,050,000}{20} = \$102,500\]

This is her annual pension after 20 years. Since she continues to receive this amount for another 10 years, her final annual pension would be:

\[Final_{annual} = \$102,500 + 10 \times \$50,000 = \$102,500 + \$500,000 = \$602,500\]

Therefore, Marcy's final annual pension would be $602,500."
"Step-by-step Answer: In a year, there are 12 months.
For the first half of the year, Aleena pays $140 x 6 = $840.
For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges her 10% less than $140, which is $140 - ($140 x 10/100) = $126.
So for the second half of the year, she pays $126 x 6 = $756.
Therefore, the total amount she paid for the streaming service by the end of the year is $840 + $756 = $1596. The answer is 1596."
"Step-by-step Answer: Sophia needs 4 gallons of gas to fill her tank, which means her tank holds 12 gallons / 4 gallons = 3 times as much gas as one full tank.

Question: Question: A man drives 60 mph for 3 hours. How fast would he have to drive over the next 2 hours to get an average speed of 70 mph?

Answer:
Step-by-Step Answer: To find out how fast he needs to drive over the next 2 hours to achieve an average speed of 70 mph, we first need to calculate the total distance he wants to cover at this new speed.

The formula for calculating average speed is:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that the desired average speed is 70 mph and the total time is \(3\) hours plus \(2\) hours (for the next \(2\) hours), we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 70 = \frac{(60 \times 3) + (x \times 2)}{3 + 2} \]

Where \(x\) represents the speed he needs to maintain over the next \(2\) hours. Simplifying the equation gives us:

\[ 70 = \frac{180 + 2x}{5} \]

Multiplying both sides by \(5\) to clear the denominator on the right side gives:

\[ 350 = 180 + 2x \]

Subtracting \(180\) from both sides gives:

\[ 170 = 2x \]

Dividing both sides by \(2\) gives:

\[ x = 85 \]

So, Tommy would need to drive at a speed of \(85\) mph over the next \(2\) hours to achieve an average speed of \(70\) mph."

" Step-by-step Answer: First, we need to calculate the total amount of money Artie will make from selling each type of flower.
For marigolds, if he sells 12 pots at $2.74 each, he will make 12 * $2.74 = $33.08.
For petunias, if he sells 9 pots at $1.87 each, he will make 9 * $1.87 = $17.83.
And for begonias, if he sells 17 pots at $2.12 each, he will make 17 * $2.12 = $35.04.
To find out how much Artie will make in total, we add up the amounts from each type of flower: $33.08 + $17.83 + $35.04 = $86.05.
So Artie will make $86.05 from selling all the flowers. The answer is $\boxed{86}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup of dog food every day.
So, the total amount of dog food used for the first 180 days is 1 cup x 180 days = 180 cups.
For the rest of the life (which is 365 days - 180 days), Cecilia feeds the puppy 2 cups of dog food every day.
So, the total amount of dog food used for the rest of the life is 2 cups x 365 days = 730 cups.
The total amount of dog food used in the first year is therefore 180 cups + 730 cups = 910 cups.
If one bag of dog food contains 110 cups, then the number of bags of dog food used in the first year is 910 cups / 110 cups/bag = 8 bags.

"Step-by-step Answer: Sylvie's initial salary was $600.
Her salary increases by 10% every year for 5 years, which amounts to an increase of 10/100*600 = $60 per year.
So, her salary after 5 years would be 600+5*60 = $700.
Since she has already worked for 5 years, she will continue this pattern for another 3 years.
The amount of increase over these 3 years would be 3*60 = $180.
Therefore, her salary after 8 years (5 years of service plus the next 3) would be 700+180 = $880.
This is her annual salary after three more years of service. The answer is 880."
" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \(H\). According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, which can be written as \(10H\).

" Step-by-step Answer: If Lee's time of 38 seconds is two seconds faster than Gerald's time, then we know that Gerald's time must be 38+2=40 seconds.
If Gerald's speed improves by 10%, it means that his new speed is 1.1 times his original speed.
So if we let G represent Gerald's original speed in seconds, we can set up the equation 1.1G = 40.
To solve for G, we divide both sides of the equation by 1.1: G = 40/1.1 = 36.36 seconds.
Therefore, Gerald's improved speed running the 400-meter hurdles is 36.36 seconds. The answer is $\boxed{36.36}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: The volume of a rectangular prism (like the boxes John has) is found by multiplying the length (L), width (W), and height (H). In this case, the length is 5 inches, the width is 6 inches, and the height is 4 inches. So the volume of one box is:

\[ \text{Volume} = L \times W \times H = 5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since John has 3 boxes, the total volume of all 3 boxes would be:

\[ \text{Total Volume} = 3 \times \text{Volume per box} = 3 \times 120 = 360 \text{ cubic inches} \]

So, the total inner volume of all 3 boxes combined is 360 cubic inches."
"Step-by-step Answer: Frankie watched a 1-hour episode of his favorite show each night from Monday through Thursday, which totals 1*4 = 4 hours.
He also watched a 30-minute show on Wednesday, which is 0.5 hours.
On Thursday, he watched a 1-hour episode and a 30-minute show, totaling 1+0.5 = 1.5 hours.
So far, he has watched 4+1.5 = 5.5 hours of TV from Monday through Thursday.
If he watched 7 hours of TV in all, then on Friday he must have watched 7-5.5 = 1.5 hours of TV.
Since each 30-minute episode is 0.5 hours long, he watched 1.5/0.5 = 3 episodes on Friday.
Therefore, on Wednesday, he watched 3-1 = 2 episodes of 30-minute shows. The answer is 2."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of cookies Henry made last year as \(x\). According to the problem, this year he plans to make twice as many as he did last year, which gives us:

\[2x = x + 15\]

Solving for \(x\) gives us:

\[2x - x = 15\]
\[x = 15\]

So, Henry made 15 cookies last year. However, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the question or the context because the information provided doesn't match the calculation above. Typically, when someone says ""he dropped 5 of his cookies,"" it implies that he initially intended to make fewer cookies than what he ended up with. But since we've already established that he made 15 cookies last year, the additional drop of 5 cookies would not change the count of cookies he made last year; it would just mean he was off by 5 cookies from his original plan. 

Given the information provided, if we assume the correct interpretation (that he made 15 cookies last year), then the total number of cookies he made this year, including the ones he dropped, would indeed be 110. This matches the given scenario where he made twice as many as he planned, dropping 5, and ending up with 110 cookies. Therefore, the correct interpretation aligns with the initial calculation of 15 cookies made last year."
" Step-by-step Answer: The gas costs $3.00 a gallon.
The app gives .20 cash back per gallon, so for 10 gallons it would be 10 * .20 = $2.00

"Step-by-step Answer: First, we need to calculate the number of fruit roll-ups each person ate.

For Beatrice:
- Her roll-up is 2 wide.
- Her roll-up is 24 long.
So, Beatrice ate \(2 \times 24 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- His roll-up is 3 wide.
- His roll-up is 14 long.
So, Marcell ate \(3 \times 14 = 42\) roll-ups.

Now, let's add the numbers together to get the total number of roll-ups they ate:

\(48 + 42 = 90\)

To find the average number of roll-ups they ate, we divide the total by the number of people (which is 2):

\(90 \div 2 = 45\)

Therefore, on average, they ate 45 fruit roll-ups."

" Step-by-step Answer: Sadie slept 8 hours on Monday.
For the next two days, she slept 2 hours less than Monday, which means she slept 8 - 2 = 6 hours each day.
So for these two days, she slept a total of 6 x 2 = 12 hours.
The rest of the week, she slept 1 hour more than the previous two days, which means she slept 6 + 1 = 7 hours each day.
There are 5 days in this part of the week (Monday through Friday), so she slept a total of 7 x 5 = 35 hours.
To find the total number of hours she slept throughout the week, we add up all the hours: 8 + 12 + 35 = 55 hours.

" Step-by-step Answer: Let's call the number of spoons Julia bought ""x"". Her husband gave her 5 spoons, so the total number of spoons she had before using any was x + 5.
She used 3 spoons to taste the stew, so the number of spoons she had left was (x + 5) - 3 = x + 2.
We know that this number is equal to 12, so we can write the equation x + 2 = 12.
To solve for x, we subtract 2 from both sides of the equation: x = 12 - 2 = 10.
So Julia bought 10 spoons. The answer is $\boxed{10}$."

"Step-by-Step Answer: First, let's find out the price of each type of fruit:

- Watermelon: Three times the price of a pepper.
- Pepper: $15 (given)
- Orange: 5 less than the price of a watermelon.

The price of an orange is:
\[ \text{Price of an orange} = \text{Price of a watermelon} - 5 \]

Since we know the price of a watermelon is three times the price of a pepper, we can express the price of a watermelon as:
\[ \text{Price of a watermelon} = 3 \times \text{Price of a pepper} \]
\[ \text{Price of a watermelon} = 3 \times \$15 = \$45 \]

Now, let's calculate the total cost for each type of fruit:

- Total cost for watermelons: \(4 \times \$45 = \$180\)
- Total cost for peppers: \(20 \times \$15 = \$300\)
- Total cost for oranges: \(10 \times (\text{Price of an orange}) = 10 \times (\text{Price of a watermelon} - 5) = 10 \times (\$45 - \$5) = 10 \times \$40 = \$400\)

Finally, let's add up all the costs to find the total amount of money Dillon will spend:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \$180 + \$300 + \$400 = \$980 \]

So, the total amount of money Dillon will spend is \$980."
"Step-by-step Answer: First find the number of minutes all the patients stay: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient = 12000 minutes
Then divide that amount by the number of minutes per hour to find the number of hours it takes: 12000 minutes / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours
Then multiply that number by the rate charged by the hospital to find its profit from patient visits: 200 hours * $200/hour = $40000
Then find the number of hours worked by the doctors: 500 patients * 24 minutes/patient / 60 minutes/hour = 200 hours
Then multiply that number by the rate charged by the hospital to find its profit from doctor's time: 200 hours * $150/hour = $30000
Then subtract the hospital's costs from its profits to find its profit before taxes: $40000 + $30000 = $70000. The answer is 70000."

"Step-by-Step Answer: First, we need to find out how many semi-automatic cars there are. We know that there are 20 cars in total and 12 of them are automatic. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is:

\[ \text{Semi-automatic cars} = \text{Total cars} - (\text{Automatic cars}) = 20 - 12 = 8 \]

Next, we want to find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic. To do this, we divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and multiply by 100:

\[ \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total cars}} \right) \times 100 = \left( \frac{8}{20} \right) \times 100 = 40\% \]

Therefore, 40% of the cars are semi-automatic."
" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of worker bees as W, the number of baby bees as B, and the number of queen bees as Q.

From the problem, we know that:

1. There are 700 bees in total.
2. Worker bees make up twice as many as baby bees, which gives us the equation \(W = 2B\).
3. Baby bees make up twice as many as queen bees, which gives us another equation \(B = 2Q\).

We also know that the total number of bees is the sum of worker bees, baby bees, and queen bees, which gives us the equation \(W + B + Q = 700\).

Substituting the expressions for \(W\) and \(B\) into this equation, we get:
\[2B + 2B + Q = 700\]
\[4B + Q = 700\]

And substituting the expression for \(B\) from the second equation into this equation, we get:
\[4(2Q) + Q = 700\]
\[8Q + Q = 700\]
\[9Q = 700\]

Solving for \(Q\), we find:
\[Q = \frac{700}{9} = 77.\overline{7}\]

Since the number of bees must be an integer, we round \(Q\) down to the nearest whole number, which is 77.

Now, substituting \(Q = 77\) back into the equation \(W + B + Q = 700\), we get:
\[W + 2(77) + 77 = 700\]
\[W + 154 + 77 = 700\]
\[W + 231 = 700\]
\[W = 700 - 231\]
\[W = 469\]

Therefore, there are 469 worker bees in the hive. The answer is $\boxed{469}$."

"Step-by-step Answer: In the first 6 hours, Debra sees 30 bees leave the hive.
In the next 6 hours, she sees half that many bees return, which is 30/2 = 15 bees.
She also sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours, which is 2*30 = 60 bees.
So far, Debra has seen 30+15+60 = 105 bees return to the hive.
Since she saw 30 bees leave the hive in the first 6 hours, the number of bees that remain in the hive is 105-30 = 75 bees.
Therefore, the number of bees that return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day is 75. The answer is 75."
" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the amount of money Brittany's mom gave the cashier as \(x\). 

The cost of a child ticket is $10, and since she bought one, the total cost for the child ticket is \(10\) dollars. 

The cost of an adult ticket is $12, and since she bought one, the total cost for the adult ticket is also \(12\) dollars. 

So, the total cost for both tickets is \(10 + 12 = 22\) dollars. 

If Brittany's mom received $8 in change, then the amount of money she gave the cashier (\(x\)) minus the change ($8) equals the total cost of the tickets (\(22\)). 

Therefore, we can set up the equation:

\[x - 8 = 22\]

To solve for \(x\), add 8 to both sides of the equation:

\[x = 22 + 8\]
\[x = 30\]

So, Brittany's mom gave the cashier $30. The answer is $\boxed{30}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook and this number is three times the number of friends Dorothy has, then we can set up an equation to find out how many friends Dorothy has:

\[ \text{Charlie's friends} = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]
\[ 12 = 3 \times \text{Dorothy's friends} \]

Solving for Dorothy's friends gives us:
\[ \text{Dorothy's friends} = \frac{12}{3} = 4 \]

Now, if James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy, we can calculate how many friends James has by multiplying Dorothy's friends by 4:

\[ \text{James's friends} = 4 \times 4 = 16 \]

So, James has 16 friends on Facebook."

"Step-by-step Answer: First find the number of yards Blake runs by multiplying the distance per trip (100 yards) by the number of trips he makes (15): 100 yards/trip * 15 trips = 1500 yards.
Then multiply the number of yards Kelly runs by the number of trips she takes to find the total distance she runs: 40 yards/two trips * 34 trips = 1360 yards.
Now add the distances Blake ran to find the combined distance Blake ran: 1500 yards + 1360 yards = 2860 yards.
Now subtract the distance Kelly ran from the distance Blake ran to find how much farther Blake ran: 2860 yards - 1360 yards = 1500 yards.
The winner ran 1500 yards more than the loser. The answer is 1500."
" Step-by-step Answer: To find out how much Raphael spent on school supplies, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together.

Firstly, let's calculate the cost of the pens:
He bought 4 pens at $1.5 each, so the total cost for the pens is \(4 \times \$1.5 = \$6\).

Next, let's calculate the cost of the notebooks:
He bought 2 notebooks at $4 each, so the total cost for the notebooks is \(2 \times \$4 = \$8\).

Then, let's calculate the cost of the bond paper:
The bond paper costs $20.

Now, let's add up all the costs to find out how much Raphael spent in total:
Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper

Substituting the values we calculated:

Total cost = \$6 (for pens) + \$8 (for notebooks) + \$20 (for bond paper)

Adding these amounts gives us:

Total cost = \$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34

So, Raphael spent a total of $34 on school supplies."
"Step-by-Step Answer: Finn starts with 11 tadpoles.
He then sees 6 tadpoles come out of hiding, so the number of tadpoles becomes 11 + 6 = 17.
Then he sees 2 tadpoles hide under a rock, so the number of tadpoles becomes 17 - 2 = 15.
So Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now. The answer is 15."
"Step-by-step Answer: On Monday, the depth of the water is 17 feet.
On Tuesday, the depth increased by 7 feet, making the total depth 17 + 7 = 24 feet.

Therefore, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet. The answer is 16."
"Step-by-step Answer: Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish.
Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin, which means he caught 10 - 5 = 5 starfish.
He also caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin, which means he caught 6 - 3 = 3 sea horses.
And he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin, which means he caught 3 + 2 = 5 clownfish.
To find out how many fish they were able to catch in total, we add up the number of each type of fish that Anakin and Locsin caught.
So, Anakin caught a total of 10 + 6 + 3 = 19 fish.
And Locsin caught a total of 5 + 3 + 5 = 13 fish.
Adding these together, they were able to catch a total of 19 + 13 = 32 fish.
The answer is $\boxed{32}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: The initial price of the bag of marbles is $20.
After 2 months, the price increases by 20% of $20, which is 0.20*20 = $4.
So, the new price after 2 months is $20+$4 = $24.
After another 2 months (a total of 4 months), the price again increases by 20% of $24, which is 0.20*24 = $4.80.
So, the new price after 4 months is $24+$4.80 = $28.80.
This pattern continues for 36 months. We can calculate the price after each set of 4 months.
After 36/4 = 9 sets of 4 months, we will have calculated the prices for 36 months.
The final price after 36 months is $28.80*9 = $259.20.
Therefore, a bag of marbles would cost $259.20 after 36 months. The answer is $259.20."
"Step-by-Step Answer: First, we need to find out the value of the doll. Since one red car costs $4 and three action figures cost as much as the doll, then the doll must cost 3 * $4 = $12.

Next, we know that the doll costs as much as 3 action figures. Therefore, if the doll costs $12, then 3 action figures also cost $12.

Since there are 3 action figures, the total cost of the action figures is 3 * $5 = $15.

Finally, to find the total worth of all toys, we add the cost of the dolls ($12) to the cost of the action figures ($15). So, the total worth of all toys is $12 + $15 = $27. The answer is 27."

" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote Seth's current age by S and Brooke's current age by B. From the problem, we know that Seth is twice as old as Brooke, which gives us the equation:

S = 2B

In 2 years, Seth will be S+2 years old and Brooke will be B+2 years old. According to the problem, the sum of their ages in 2 years will be 28, which gives us another equation:

(S+2) + (B+2) = 28

We can substitute the first equation into this second one:

(2B+2) + (B+2) = 28

This simplifies to:

3B + 4 = 28

Subtracting 4 from both sides gives:

3B = 24

Dividing both sides by 3 gives:

B = 8

Now that we know Brooke's current age is 8, we can find Seth's current age by substituting B back into the first equation:

S = 2B = 2*8 = 16

So, Seth is currently 16 years old. The answer is $\boxed{16}$."

Then subtract the time spent on cutting potatoes to find the total time spent on peeling: 90 seconds / 60 seconds/potato = 1.5 potatoes
Then multiply that number by the number of potatoes per batch to find the total time spent cutting potatoes: 5 seconds/potato * 1.5 potatoes = 7.5 seconds
Finally, add the time spent peeling and cutting potatoes to find the total prep time: 7.5 seconds + 90 seconds = 97.5 seconds. The answer is 97.5."
" Step-by-step Answer: To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we first need to calculate their total revenue and then subtract the cost of the lemons.

First, let's figure out how many gallons of lemonade they sold. Since they get 20 glasses per gallon and each glass sells for $0.50, the number of glasses sold is:

\[ \text{Number of glasses} = 20 \times \text{Gallons} \]
\[ \text{Number of glasses} = 20 \times 1 = 20 \]

Since each gallon makes them $0.50, the total revenue from selling all the lemonade is:

\[ \text{Total Revenue} = \text{Number of glasses} \times \$0.50 \]
\[ \text{Total Revenue} = 20 \times \$0.50 = \$10 \]

Next, we know that they spent $3 for lemons and $2 for sugar, which totals:

\[ \text{Cost of lemons and sugar} = \$3 + \$2 = \$5 \]

Finally, to find out how much they spent on lemons, we subtract the cost of lemons and sugar from their total revenue:

\[ \text{Amount spent on lemons} = \text{Total Revenue} - (\text{Cost of lemons and sugar}) \]
\[ \text{Amount spent on lemons} = \$10 - \$5 = \$5 \]

So, Juan and Carlos spent $5 on lemons."

" Step-by-step Answer: Zaid's monthly salary is $6000.
He spends 1/4 of his salary on rent, which is (1/4) * $6000 = $1500.
He also spends 1/3 of his salary on car fuel, which is (1/3) * $6000 = $2000.
So far, he has spent $1500 + $2000 = $3500.
The remaining amount after these expenses is $6000 - $3500 = $2500.
He then donates half of this remaining amount to his favorite charity, which is (1/2) * $2500 = $1250.
After donating to his favorite charity, he has $2500 - $1250 = $1250 remaining.
He gives his daughter $200 for her weekly expenses and $700 to his wife for groceries and other household goods.
So, he gives away a total of $200 + $700 = $900.
After giving away this money, he will have $1250 - $900 = $350 remaining.
Therefore, Zaid will still have $350 after all these expenses and donations. The answer is $\boxed{350}$."

" Step 1: Find Jan's current age.
We know that Jan is currently 30 years old.
Two years ago, Jan would be 30 - 2 = 28 years old.
So, we need to find out how old Mark was two years ago.
Since Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age two years ago, we can set up an equation:
Mark's age two years ago = (Jan's age two years ago) / 2 + 5
Substituting the value of Jan's age two years ago, we get:
Mark's age two years ago = (28) / 2 + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19
Now, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark.
So, Jean's age = Mark's age + 2
Substituting the value of Mark's age, we get:
Jean's age = 19 + 2 = 21

Therefore, Jean is currently 21 years old. The answer is: $21$."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's calculate the time it takes for each team to complete the 400-meter relay race.
For the better team (the one with all four runners running in 55 seconds), the total time would be:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}. \]

For the second team (with the slower runners), we need to find out how long it takes for each runner to finish their part of the race.
The first runner runs in 60 seconds.
The second runner runs in 60 - 3 = 57 seconds.
The third runner runs in 57 - 3 = 54 seconds.
The fourth runner runs in 54 - 3 = 51 seconds.

To find the total time for the second team, we add up the times of all four runners:
\[ \text{Total Time} = 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 220 \text{ seconds}. \]

Now, we compare the total times of both teams to see which team wins the race.
Since the total time for the second team is 220 seconds, and the total time for the first team is 220 seconds, the second team wins the race by 0 seconds.
Therefore, the answer is $\boxed{0}$ seconds."
"Step-by-step Answer: To find out how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability of each event separately and then compare them.

### Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3

The possible outcomes when rolling a six-sided die are:
- 1
- 2
- 3
- 4
- 5
- 6

Out of these, the numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is:

\[ P(\text{Rolling a number greater than 3}) = \frac{\text{Number of favorable outcomes}}{\text{Total number of outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} \]

### Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row

To roll two even numbers in a row, one must first roll an even number (which can be any of the 3 even numbers on the die). Once this happens, the next roll must also be an even number to complete the sequence. 

There are 3 even numbers on the die: 2, 4, and 6. Since the order matters (rolling 2, 4, or 6 is different from rolling 4, 2, or 6), we use combinations since the order doesn't matter here. The number of ways to choose 2 even numbers out of 3 is given by the combination formula \(C(n, k) = \frac{n!}{k!(n-k)!}\), where \(n\) is the total number of items, \(k\) is the number of items to choose, and ""!"" denotes factorial.

So, the number of ways to choose 2 even numbers out of 3 is \(C(3, 2) = \frac{3!}{2!(3-2)!} = \frac{3 \times 2}{2 \times 1} = 3\).

Therefore, the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row is:

\[ P(\text{Rolling two even numbers in a row}) = \frac{3}{3} = 1 \]

### Comparing the Probabilities

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

- Rolling a number greater than 3: \(\frac{1}{2}\)
- Rolling two even numbers in a row: \(1\)

Since \(1 > \frac{1}{2}\), it is more likely for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row. Therefore, the correct answer is that it is \(100\%\) more likely for him to roll a number greater than 3 than to roll two even numbers in a row."
"Step-by-step Answer: If Jenna's mother picked 20 apples, then Jenna picked half as many, which means Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.

" Step-by-step Answer: In the first month, Mandy will owe Benedict 100*0.02 = $2 more.
So, Mandy will owe Benedict 100+2 = $102 after the first month.
In the second month, Mandy will owe Benedict 102*0.02 = $2.04 more.
So, Mandy will owe Benedict 102+2.04 = $104.04 after the second month.
In the third month, Mandy will owe Benedict 104.04*0.02 = $2.0808 more.
So, Mandy will owe Benedict 104.04+2.0808 = $106.1208 after the third month.
Since Mandy paid it after 3 months, she should give Benedict 106.1208-100 = $6.1208. The answer is 6.1208."
" Step-by-step Answer: Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \(x\). 

The cost of buying the bags is \(20x\) dollars, because each bag costs $20. 

The cost of transporting the bags is \(2x\) dollars, because there are 2 bags transported per bag purchased, and each bag costs $20, so the transportation cost is \(2 \times 20 = 40\) dollars.

So, the total cost of buying and transporting the bags is \(20x + 40\) dollars.

The trader sold all the bags at a rate of $30 each, so the revenue from selling the bags is \(30x\) dollars.

The trader made a total profit of $400, which means the revenue minus the cost equals the profit. We can write this as an equation:

\[30x - (20x + 40) = 400\]

Solving this equation will give us the value of \(x\), the number of bags the trader bought.

First, simplify the equation:

\[30x - 20x - 40 = 400\]

Combine like terms:

\[10x - 40 = 400\]

Add 40 to both sides:

\[10x = 440\]

Divide by 10:

\[x = 44\]

So, the trader bought 44 bags of wheat. The answer is $\boxed{44}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: The total cost of the tickets was $20.25.
The cost of the food was $20.25 - $4.50 = $15.75.

" Step-by-step Answer: To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we first calculate the current total of her scores before the sixth test.
She has already taken 5 tests and scored 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. Adding these up gives us a total of:
\[89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 438.\]
To have an average of 93 over 6 tests, the sum of all her scores must be:
\[93 \times 6 = 558.\]
Since she has already scored 438, the score she needs on the sixth test is:
\[558 - 438 = 120.\]
Therefore, Brinley needs to score 120 on the sixth test to have an average of 93. The answer is $\boxed{120}$."
" Step-by-step Answer: In the first period, Micheal rides the bike 5 times a week for 25 km each time, which totals to 5*25 = 125 km per week.
In the second period, Micheal rides the bike 2 times a week for 60 km each time, which totals to 2*60 = 120 km per week.
Since he did this for three weeks, the total distance covered during these periods is 125+120 = 245 km.
Therefore, the total distance covered by Micheal over the two periods is 245+125 = 370 km. The answer is 370."
"Step-by-step Answer: The weight of the candies in the bag is the sum of the weights of the chocolate bars and candied apples. Since each chocolate bar weighs 40g, then the total weight of the chocolate bars is 25*40 = 1000g.
The weight of the candied apples is 80*40 = 3200g.
Therefore, the total weight of the candies in the bag is 1000+3200 = 4200g. The answer is 4200."
" Step-by-step Answer: On Monday Rose bought 4 cakes.
On Tuesday she bought three times as many as she bought on Monday, which is $3 \times 4 = 12$ cakes.
On Wednesday she bought five times as many as she bought on Tuesday, which is $5 \times 12 = 60$ cakes.
To find out how many cakes she bought in total, we add up the number of cakes she bought each day: $4 + 12 + 60 = 76$.
So Rose bought 76 cakes in total after all three days. The answer is $\boxed{76}$."
"Step-by-Step Answer: A dozen contains 12 items, so twenty dozen contain 20*12 = 240 cups.
If twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than half a dozen plates which sell for $6000 each, then the total cost of the plates is $6000/2+1200 = $3600+1200 = $4800.
Since twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than this amount, the total cost of the cups is $4800-$1200 = $3600.
Since one dozen contains 12 cups, twenty dozen contain 20*12=240 cups.
Therefore, the cost of each cup is $3600/240 = $15. The answer is 15."
" Step-by-step Answer: First, let's calculate how much Sara needs to earn in total. The jacket costs $30 and each pair of shoes costs $20, so the total cost of the jacket and shoes is $30 + ($20 x 2) = $30 + $40 = $70.
Next, we need to figure out how much money Sara earns babysitting the neighbors' kids. She earns $5 each time she babysits them, and she babysits them 4 times, so she earns $5 x 4 = $20.
Her parents also pay her $4 each time she mows the lawn, and she mows the lawn 4 times, so she earns $4 x 4 = $16.
Now, let's add up all the money Sara has earned so far. She has $10 saved and she has earned $20 from babysitting and $16 from mowing the lawn, so she has $10 + $20 + $16 = $46.
To find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn, we subtract the amount she already has from what she needs to earn. She needs to earn $70 - $46 = $24.
Since she earns $4 each time she mows the lawn, we divide the remaining amount by the amount she earns per mowing session to find out how many sessions she needs to mow. So, $24 / $4 = 6.
Therefore, Sara must mow the lawn 6 times before she can afford the jacket and shoes. The answer is $\boxed{6}$."
"Step-by-step Answer: Let's say the number of red chickens is \(R\). Since Jerry has two more white chickens than red ones, the number of white chickens is \(R+2\).

Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, so \(R\) red chickens produce \(3 \times R\) eggs per day.

Each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day, so \(R+2\) white chickens produce \(5 \times (R+2)\) eggs per day.

Together, these chickens produce 42 eggs per day, so we can set up the equation:

\[3R + 5(R + 2) = 42\]

Expanding the equation gives us:

\[3R + 5R + 10 = 42\]

Combining like terms:

\[8R + 10 = 42\]

Subtracting 10 from both sides:

\[8R = 32\]

Dividing by 8:

\[R = 4\]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."

" Step-by-step Answer: Let x represent the amount of water in the small pool 4 minutes ago.
Then the big pool had 2x gallons of water.
Now the big pool has 4x gallons of water.
Since the leak empties the pools at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, we know that 4(4) = 16 gallons have leaked out of the big pool since 4 minutes ago.
So the big pool now has 4x - 16 gallons of water.
And since the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, we can set up an equation:

Question: Question: A man drives 60 mph for 3 hours. How fast would he have to drive over the next 2 hours to get an average speed of 70 mph?

Answer:
Step-by-Step Answer: To find out how fast he needs to drive over the next 2 hours to achieve an average speed of 70 mph, we first need to calculate the total distance he wants to cover at this new speed.

The formula for calculating average speed is:

\[ \text{Average Speed} = \frac{\text{Total Distance}}{\text{Total Time}} \]

Given that the desired average speed is 70 mph and the total time is \(3\) hours plus \(2\) hours (for the next 2 hours), we can set up the equation as follows:

\[ 70 = \frac{(60 \times 3) + (x \times 2)}{3 + 2} \]

Where \(x\) represents the speed he needs to maintain over the next 2 hours. Simplifying the equation gives us:

\[ 70 = \frac{180 + 2x}{5} \]

Multiplying both sides by \(5\) to clear the denominator on the right side gives:

\[ 350 = 180 + 2x \]

Subtracting \(180\) from both sides gives:

\[ 170 = 2x \]

Dividing both sides by \(2\) gives:

\[ x = 85 \]

So, he needs to drive at a speed of \(85\) mph for the next 2 hours to achieve an average speed of \(70\) mph over the entire period."

"Step-by-Step Answer: James starts with 30 fire type, 20 grass type, and 40 water type cards.
He loses 8 of the water type, so he has 40 - 8 = 32 water type cards remaining.
He also buys 14 more grass type cards, so he now has 20 + 14 = 34 grass type cards.
The total number of cards he has now is 32 + 34 = 66 cards.
To find the probability of picking a water type card, we need to divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards.
So the probability is 32/66.
To convert this to a percentage, we multiply by 100.
(32/66) * 100 = 48.4848...
Rounded to the nearest integer, the probability is 48%. The answer is 48."
" Step-by-step Answer: The base burrito costs $6.50.
He adds extra meat for $2.00, extra cheese for $1.00, avocado for $1.00, and 2 sauces for $0.25 each, so that's 2*$0.25 = $0.50.
The total cost before the upgrade is $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 = $11.00.
He upgrades his meal for an extra $3.00, so the total cost becomes $11.00 + $3.00 = $14.00.
He uses a gift card for $5.00, so the final amount he owes is $14.00 - $5.00 = $9.00.
So, Chad still owes $9.00. The answer is $\boxed{9}$."

" Step-by-step Answer: Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Fries**: Griffin initially had 24 fries.
2. **Kyle Takes**: Kyle took 5 fries.
3. **Billy Takes**: Billy took twice as many as Kyle, which means Billy took \(2 \times 5 = 10\) fries.
4. **Ginger Gives**: Griffin received a handful of fries from Ginger, let's say \(x\) fries.
5. **Colby Takes**: Colby took 3 less than what Kyle took, which means Colby took \(5 - 3 = 2\) fries.

After all these transactions, Griffin ended up with 27 fries. We need to find out how many fries Ginger gave Griffin.

First, we calculate the total number of fries after all the transactions:
\[24 (initial) - 5 (taken by Kyle) - 10 (taken by Billy) + x (given by Ginger) - 3 (taken by Colby) = 27\]

Simplifying this equation gives us:
\[24 - 5 - 10 + x - 3 = 27\]
\[12 + x = 27\]
\[x = 27 - 12\]
\[x = 15\]

So, Ginger gave Griffin 15 fries."
"Step-by-Step Answer: In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails.
In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails.
The total number of snails in both aquariums is 4 + 32 = 36.
If the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums, then we can set up an equation:
|Snail count in first aquarium - Snail count in second aquarium| = 2 * Fish count in both aquariums
|4 - 32| = 2 * Fish count in both aquariums
|-28| = 2 * Fish count in both aquariums
28 = 2 * Fish count in both aquariums
Fish count in both aquariums = 28 / 2
Fish count in both aquariums = 14
Since both aquariums have the same number of fish, there are also 14 fish in each aquarium. The answer is 14."
