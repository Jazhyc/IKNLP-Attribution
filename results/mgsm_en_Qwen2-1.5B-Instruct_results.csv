"1) Janet's ducks lay 16 eggs a day, and she eats 3, so she has 16 - 3 = 13 fresh eggs.
2) She uses 4 for baking muffins, leaving her with 13 - 4 = 9 eggs.
3) She sells the remaining 9 eggs at $2 each, making 9 * $2 = $18.
The answer is 18."
"1) A bolt of blue fiber costs $2.
2) A bolt of white fiber costs twice as much as a bolt of blue fiber, so it costs 2*2=$4.
3) The total number of bolts required is 2 (for blue) plus 4 (for white), which equals 2+4=6.
The answer is 6."
"1) The original price of the house was $80,000 and Josh put $50,000 into it so it's worth $80,000 + $50,000 = $130,000.
2) Since this increase in value is 150% of the original price, the original price is $130,000 / (1 + 150%) = $130,000 / 2.5 = $52,000.
3) The profit is the final price minus the initial purchase price, so it's $52,000 - $80,000 = -$28,000.
The answer is -28000."
"To find out the total number of meters James runs in a week, we need to calculate the distance he covers during one sprint and then multiply it by the number of sprints he runs per week.

He runs 60 meters each sprint.

Since he runs three sprints per week, we multiply the distance of one sprint (60 meters) by the number of sprints (3):

\[ \text{Total distance} = 60\, \text{meters/sprint} \times 3\, \text{sprints/week} = 180\, \text{meters/week}. \]

So, James runs a total of 180 meters in a week."
"To find out how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal, let's first calculate the total amount of feed given to all chickens throughout the day:

- In the morning, she gives each chicken 15 cups of feed.
- In the afternoon, she gives each chicken an additional 25 cups of feed.
- The size of Wendi's flock is 20 chickens.

So, the total amount of feed given during the day is \(15 \times 20\) (morning) + \(25 \times 20\) (afternoon), which equals \(300\) cups of feed.

Since the question asks for the amount of feed needed in the final meal, we simply subtract the total feed given from the morning and afternoon meals from the overall daily feed requirement.

Thus, the amount of feed needed in the final meal would be \(300 - 300 = 0\) cups.

This means Wendi doesn't need any extra feed in the final meal; she has already provided enough for all the chickens according to the plan.

However, since the question seems to have a discrepancy or misunderstanding regarding the number of chickens, it's important to clarify the context before providing an accurate response."
"1) Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses, so we need to calculate the price for all of them first.
2) The first glasses will cost 16 * 5 = 80 dollars.
3) Every second glasses will cost 60/100 * 5 = 3 dollars.
4) Since Kylar is buying 16 glasses, then out of these 16 glasses, half will cost 3 dollars each and the other half will cost 5 dollars each.
5) Thus, Kylar needs to pay (16 / 2) * 3 + (16 / 2) * 5 = 60 dollars.
The answer is 60."

The answer is 140."
"To find out how long it took Carla to download the file, we first need to determine the time it took for her to finish the download once she started again from the beginning. 

Initially, she could download 2 GB per minute, so for the first half (or 100GB), she would take \( \frac{100}{2} = 50\) minutes. However, since she had to restart due to Windows, this second part of the download was not counted towards her initial speed of 2 GB/minute.

When she restarted the download, she began at the point where she had downloaded 40% of the original file, which means she had already downloaded \( 200 \times 0.4 = 80\) GB by then. Since she had to start from the beginning again, the additional time taken for the second part of the download is \( \frac{80}{2} = 40\) minutes.

Therefore, the total time to download the entire file is \( 50 + 40 = 90\) minutes."

"To calculate how many years it takes Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to consider both the initial investment (cost of planting) and the revenue generated by selling the lemons. 

First, let's calculate the annual profit from selling lemons:

Each lemon sold generates a profit of $1.5 - $0.5 (cost per lemon), or $1.

Since each lemon requires $3 to grow, the net gain from one lemon is $1.5 - $3/7. We'll multiply this amount by the number of lemons produced in a year to find the annual profit:

\[ \text{Annual Profit} = (\$1.5 - \$\frac{3}{7}) \times 7 \]

\[ \text{Annual Profit} = (\$1.5 - \$0.42857)\times 7 \]

\[ \text{Annual Profit} = \$0.07142857 \times 7 \]

\[ \text{Annual Profit} = \$0.50 \]

So, the annual profit from selling lemons is $0.50.

Next, we add the annual cost of growing the trees ($3) to the annual profit to see if Carlos makes any money:

\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \$3 + \$0.50 \]

\[ \text{Total Annual Cost} = \$3.50 \]

Now, we divide the total annual cost by the annual profit to determine how long it will take Carlos to break even:

\[ \text{Years to Break Even} = \frac{\text{Total Annual Cost}}{\text{Annual Profit}} \]

\[ \text{Years to Break Even} = \frac{\$3.50}{\$0.50} \]

\[ \text{Years to Break Even} = 7 \]

Therefore, it will take Carlos 7 years to start earning money from his lemon tree."
"Let's denote the number of vacuum cleaners Melanie started with as \(V\).

According to the problem:

1. She sold one-third of her vacuum cleaners at the green house, which leaves \(V/3\) vacuum cleaners remaining.
2. She then sold 2 more vacuum cleaners to the red house, leaving \(V/3 - 2\) vacuum cleaners.
3. Finally, she sold half of what was left at the orange house, which leaves \((V/3 - 2)/2\) vacuum cleaners.

Given that this final amount is 5, we set up the equation:

\[
\frac{V}{3} - 2 = \frac{1}{2}\left(\frac{V}{3} - 2\right)
\]

Multiplying everything by 6 (to clear the denominators) gives us:

\[2V - 12 = V - 6\]

Solving for \(V\), we add \(V\) to both sides and subtract 12 from both sides to get:

\[V = 18\]

Therefore, Melanie started with 18 vacuum cleaners.
The answer is $\boxed{18}$."
"1) There are 20 students in the class.
2) 20% of them enrolled in contemporary dance which is 20*0.20 = 4 students.
3) The remaining number of students is 20 - 4 = 16.
4) 25% of these 16 students enrolled in jazz dance which is 16*0.25 = 4 students.
5) Therefore, the number of students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is 16 - 4 = 12 students.
6) Hence, the percentage of the entire students who enrolled in hip-hop dance is (12/20)*100 = 60%
The answer is 60."
"To find out how much profit the merchant would gain by choosing one over the other based on the given percentages, we need to calculate the difference in price before applying the percentage increases.

Let's assume the original prices are as follows:

Jewelry: $5,000
Electronic Gadgets: $8,000

For Jewelry:
Price increase = 2.5% of $5,000 = (2.5/100) * $5,000 = $125

So, the new price for Jewelry = Original Price + Increase = $5,000 + $125 = $5,125

For Electronic Gadgets:
Price increase = 1.2% of $8,000 = (1.2/100) * $8,000 = $96

So, the new price for Electronic Gadgets = Original Price + Increase = $8,000 + $96 = $8,096

Now, let's calculate the profit:

Profit = New Price for Jewelry - Original Price of Jewelry
= $5,125 - $5,000
= $125

Therefore, the merchant would gain $125 if he chooses to buy the jewelry instead of the electronics gadget, assuming the market conditions remain constant throughout the month."
"1) On the first day, the distance traveled was 80 miles.

"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to add together her earnings from teaching and coaching.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:

- Teaching: $20/hour * 50 hours/week = $1000/week
- Coaching: $30/week

So, her combined weekly earnings from teaching and coaching are $1000 (teaching) + $30 (coaching) = $1030/week.

Next, we'll find out how much she earns in a year by multiplying her weekly earnings by the number of weeks in a year:

- Weekly earnings: $1030/week
- Weeks in a year: 50 weeks/year

Therefore, her annual earnings are $1030/week * 50 weeks/year = $51500/year.

Jill's annual salary is $51500.
The answer is: $51500$"
"There are 7 days in a week and 4 weeks make 4*7=28 days.
If Claire makes a 3 egg omelette everyday then over 28 days she will eat 3*28=72 eggs

"To find out how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we first need to determine when Raymond's son was actually born. We know that:

- Samantha is currently 31 years old.
- Raymond is 6 years older than Samantha, so Raymond is \(31 + 6 = 37\) years old now.

We're told Raymond had a son who was 23 years old at that time. To find out when Raymond's son was born, we subtract Raymond's current age from the son's age at that time:

\[37 \text{ (Raymond's current age)} - 23 \text{ (son's age)} = 14 \text{ years}.\]

So, Raymond's son was born 14 years ago."

"To find out how long it takes for a candle to burn from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the difference between these times in hours. 

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is 4 hours.

Given that the candle melts 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours by the rate at which the candle melts:

\[ \text{Candle length} = 2\text{ cm/hour} \times 4\text{ hours} = 8\text{ cm} \]

So, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle would be 8 centimeters shorter than its original length."
" The discount on the book is 25%, which means Kyle paid 100% - 25% = 75% of the original price.
Let's represent the original price as \(x\).
So, 75% of \(x\) is equal to $19.50.
We can write this as an equation: \[0.75x = 19.50.\]
To solve for \(x\), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75: \[\frac{0.75x}{0.75} = \frac{19.50}{0.75},\] which simplifies to \[x = \frac{19.50}{0.75} = 26.\]
Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.
The answer is $\boxed{26}$."
"To find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, let's first calculate the total cost of all the items except for the pizza.

1. The cost of one chicken meal is $12.
2. The cost of 5 packs of milk is \(5 \times \$3 = \$15\).
3. The cost of 4 apples is \(4 \times \$1.50 = \$6\).

Adding these together gives us the initial cost before adding any pizza:

\[\$12 (chicken meal) + \$15 (milk) + \$6 (apples) = \$33\]

Given that Marie paid a total of $50, we need to subtract the initial cost of $33 from this amount to find out how much was spent on pizza:

\[Total \ cost - Initial \ cost = Cost \ of \ Pizza\]
\[\$50 - \$33 = \$17\]

Now, knowing that each box of pizza costs $8.50, we can divide the total cost of pizza by the price per box to find out how many boxes were purchased:

\[\frac{\$17}{\$8.50} = 2\]

So, Marie ordered 2 boxes of pizza."
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the cost of each item individually and then add them together.

For the shorts:

- One pair costs $16.50

Since there are 3 pairs of shorts, the total cost for the shorts is \(3 \times \$16.50\).

\(3 \times \$16.50 = \$50.50\)

For the pants:

- One pair costs $22.50

Since there are 3 pairs of pants, the total cost for the pants is \(3 \times \$22.50\).

\(3 \times \$22.50 = \$67.50\)

For the shoes:

- One pair costs $42

Since there are 3 pairs of shoes, the total cost for the shoes is \(3 \times \$42\).

\(3 \times \$42 = \$126\)

Now, let's add up the costs for the shorts, pants, and shoes:

Total cost = Cost of shorts + Cost of pants + Cost of shoes
Total cost = \$50.50 + \$67.50 + \$126

Adding these amounts gives us the total amount Mishka spent on all the clothing items:

Total cost = \$50.50 + \$67.50 + \$126 = \$244

Therefore, Mishka spent a total of $244 on all the clothing items."
"To find out how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days, we first need to calculate the number of servings she consumes in those 60 days.

Since she eats one serving of ice cream every night, and there are 30 days in a month (assuming July), she would eat \(30 \times 1 = 30\) servings of ice cream in a month.

Over 60 days, which is twice as long, she would consume \(30 \times 2 = 60\) servings of ice cream.

Each carton contains 15 servings, so to get 60 servings, she would need \(60 / 15 = 4\) cartons of ice cream.

Given that each carton costs $4.00, the total amount spent would be \(4 \times $4.00 = $16.00\).

Therefore, after 60 days, Cynthia will spend $16.00 on ice cream.
The answer is $\boxed{16}$."
"1) The first stop was 20 miles away from the start point, which means Henry traveled 60 - 20 = 40 miles before stopping.

The answer is 25."
"Let's denote the price of the boots as \(B\) dollars. According to the problem:

1. The price of one pair of high heels is $33, which is twice the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write this relationship as \(2B = 33\).

2. It also says that ""two pairs of high heels"" cost ""five dollars less than the boots."" This gives us another equation: \(2 \times 33 = B - 5\), or \(66 = B - 5\). Solving for \(B\) gives us \(B = 71\).

So, the boots cost $71."
"1) The ratio of Darrell's and Allen's ages is 7 : 11.
2) Their total age is 162, meaning the sum of their ages is 7+11=18 parts.
3) Since one part represents a certain number of years, 162 divided by 18 equals 9 years per part.
4) Thus, if Allen is currently x years old, then 9x=162, which means x=18 years old.
5) Therefore, Allen will be 18+10=28 years old 10 years from now.
The answer is 28."

"To find out how many hours John spends taking care of dogs each week, we need to calculate the daily walking and caring time for all dogs combined and then multiply by the number of days in a week (assuming it's seven days).

Each dog takes 0.5 hours per day to walk and take care of their business. With 10 dogs, the total walking and caring time for one dog per day would be:

\[ \text{Dog Time} = 0.5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/day} \]

Since this process repeats every day for all 10 dogs, the total walking and caring time for all dogs in a single day would be:

\[ \text{Total Dog Time} = 5 \text{ hours/dog/day} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 50 \text{ hours/day} \]

Given that there are 7 days in a week, the total weekly walking and caring time for all dogs would be:

\[ \text{Weekly Total Dog Time} = 50 \text{ hours/day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 350 \text{ hours/week} \]

Therefore, John spends 350 hours a week taking care of dogs."
"1) We know that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Let's denote the number of silver coins as x. Therefore, the number of gold coins will be x+30. The total amount of coins is given by the sum of gold and silver coins which equals 110. So we have the equation: x + (x+30) = 110.
2) Solving this equation gives us: 2x + 30 = 110.
3) Subtracting 30 from both sides gives: 2x = 80.
4) Dividing both sides by 2 gives: x = 40. This means that there are 40 silver coins.
5) To find out how many gold coins Gretchen has, we substitute x=40 into the expression x+30: 40 + 30 = 70.
The answer is 70."
"1) Half of Raymond's jewels is 40 / 2 = 20 jewels.
2) Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels, which is 20 + 5 = 25 jewels.

"In the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points. 

For the next 20 minutes (the second part), he scored 25% more points than what he scored in the first 20 minutes. This means he scored \(4 \times 1.25 = 5\) points in this time.

To find the total number of points he scored over these 40 minutes, we add the points from both parts:

\(4 + 5 = 9\) points in total."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we first need to calculate the daily cost of yogurt and then multiply it by the number of days.

Each pack of yogurt contains 4 yogurts and costs $5.00. Therefore, the price per yogurt is:

\[ \text{Price per yogurt} = \frac{\$5.00}{4} = \$1.25 \]

Since Terry eats 2 yogurts a day, the daily cost of yogurt is:

\[ \text{Daily cost of yogurt} = 2 \times \$1.25 = \$2.50 \]

Over 30 days, the total cost would be:

\[ \text{Total cost} = 30 \times \$2.50 = \$75.00 \]

Therefore, Terry spends $75.00 on yogurt over 30 days."
"To find out how many lego sets John still has, we first need to calculate the total amount of money he earned from selling his lego sets.

He sold each lego set for $15, and he had 13 sets, so:

Total earnings from lego sets = 13 lego sets * $15 per set

Let's calculate this:

Total earnings from lego sets = 13 * $15 = $195

Next, we know he spent a certain amount on video games, which was $20 per game and he bought 8 games:

Total spent on video games = 8 games * $20 per game

Now let's calculate this:

Total spent on video games = 8 * $20 = $160

Finally, we subtract the total spent on video games from his total earnings to find out how much he had left:

Money left = Total earnings from lego sets - Total spent on video games

Let's calculate this:

Money left = $195 - $160 = $35

We're told he has $5 left after these transactions, which matches the money left calculation (since if he had $x left, it would mean he spent x dollars on video games). Therefore, we can conclude that John initially had $195 - $5 = $190 before buying the video games.

Since he started with 13 lego sets and spent $190 on video games, we can find out how many lego sets he still has by dividing the total amount spent on video games by the price of one lego set:

Lego sets remaining = Money spent / Price per lego set

Let's calculate this:

Lego sets remaining = $190 / $15 per set = 12.67 sets

However, since you can't have a fraction of a lego set, we'll round down to the nearest whole number because you can't have part of a lego set. 

So, John still has 12 lego sets.

This is based on the assumption that you cannot sell fractions of a lego set or purchase non-standard quantities. In reality, Lego sets are typically sold in multiples of 1 or 1.5 (e.g., 12, 15, etc.), making this an approximation."

"To solve this problem, we first need to determine Dana's running speed and then calculate how long she spends running and walking over the span of six hours.

Given:
- Dana runs at a speed four times faster than she walks.
- Dana skips at 3 miles per hour (mph).

First, let's find out Dana's walking speed:

\[ \text{Walking Speed} = \frac{\text{Running Speed}}{4} \]

Since we know Dana skips at 3 mph, we use the information about skipping to find her running speed:

\[ \text{Running Speed} = 3 \, \text{mph} \times 4 = 12 \, \text{mph} \]

Now, let's calculate how long she spends running and walking:

\[ \text{Time Running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 2 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Time Walking} = \frac{2}{3} \times 6 \, \text{hours} = 4 \, \text{hours} \]

Next, we'll calculate how far she travels during these periods:

For Running:
\[ \text{Distance Running} = \text{Speed Running} \times \text{Time Running} = 12 \, \text{mph} \times 2 \, \text{hours} = 24 \, \text{miles} \]

For Walking:
\[ \text{Distance Walking} = \text{Speed Walking} \times \text{Time Walking} = 3 \, \text{mph} \times 4 \, \text{hours} = 12 \, \text{miles} \]

Adding these distances together gives us the total distance traveled:

\[ \text{Total Distance Traveled} = \text{Distance Running} + \text{Distance Walking} = 24 \, \text{miles} + 12 \, \text{miles} = 36 \, \text{miles} \]

Therefore, Dana can travel 36 miles in six hours by combining running and walking."
"1) Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
2) Ben's iPhone is twice this age, which means it is 1*2 = 2 years old.
3) Brandon's iPhone is four times this age, meaning it is 2*4 = 8 years old.
The answer is 8."
"To solve this problem, we first need to understand the relationship between the dragon's ability to breathe fire (its power), Polly's throwing distance with the gold javelin (her range), and whether or not she holds the sapphire gemstone.

Given that:
- The dragon's breath burns everything within 1000 feet of it.
- Polly can throw the gold javelin up to 400 feet, which is within the dragon's reach.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, her javelin throws an additional 3 times its normal range. This means that instead of throwing the javelin 400 feet, she can throw it as far as \(400 \times 3 = 1200\) feet.

With the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand even further away from the dragon without being burned by its breath. Since the dragon's breath reaches 1000 feet, with the sapphire gemstone, Polly can stand 1200 feet away from the dragon without being burned.

Therefore, Polly can stand 1200 feet outside the reach of the dragon's flames while holding the sapphire gemstone."
"To find out how many pieces of pie were taken by the guests, we first need to determine the total number of pieces Grandma Jones made and then subtract the 14 pieces that remained.

She baked 5 apple pies and cut each pie into 8 pieces:

\[ \text{Total pieces} = 5 \times 8 = 40 \]

After giving away the pies and serving the rest, there were 14 pieces left. To find out how many pieces were taken by the guests, we subtract these from the total pieces:

\[ \text{Pieces taken} = \text{Total pieces} - \text{Remaining pieces} \]
\[ \text{Pieces taken} = 40 - 14 \]
\[ \text{Pieces taken} = 26 \]

Therefore, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests."
"1) A bag of chips contains 5 servings, each containing 250 calories. Therefore, one bag of chips contains 5 * 250 = 1250 calories.
2) You need to consume 2000 calories every day, so you can eat up to 2000 / 1250 = 1.6 bags of chips.
3) Since you've already consumed 1800 calories, you're able to consume an additional 2000 - 1800 = 200 calories.
4) One bag of chips contains 1250 calories, so if you can eat an additional 200 calories, then you can eat 1250 + 200 = 1450 grams of chips.
The answer is 1450."
"To find Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles, we need to calculate his costs first.

1. **Cost of Beeswax**: Since one pound of beeswax makes 10 candles and Charlie needs to make 20 candles, he will need 2 pounds of beeswax (since 20 / 10 = 2).

   The cost of the beeswax is therefore \(2 \times \$10.00 = \$20.00\).

2. **Wick Costs**: Since one pound of beeswax requires a wick, and since Charlie uses 1 pound of beeswax per 10 candles, he will need 2 wicks (\(2 \times 10 = 20\) wicks).

   The cost of the wicks is thus \(20 \times \$1.00 = \$20.00\).

3. **Total Cost**: Adding the cost of the beeswax and wicks together gives us the total cost:

   Total cost = Cost of beeswax + Wicks' cost
   Total cost = \$20.00 + \$20.00
   Total cost = \$40.00

4. **Selling Price per Candle**: Since he sells each candle for $2.00, and he plans to make and sell 20 candles,

   Selling price per candle = $2.00
   Revenue from selling all candles = 20 candles × $2.00/candle
   Revenue from selling all candles = $40.00

5. **Net Profit**: To find the net profit, subtract the total cost from the revenue:

   Net profit = Revenue from selling all candles - Total cost
   Net profit = $40.00 - \$40.00
   Net profit = $0.00

Therefore, Charlie's net profit from making and selling 20 candles would be $0.00, meaning he neither made any profit nor loss on the transaction."
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to break down her work into individual calculations based on the information provided:

1. **Monday**: She wrote 5 articles.
2. **Tuesday**: She wrote 2/5 times more articles than on Monday. Since she wrote 5 articles on Monday, she wrote \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5\).
3. **Wednesday**: She wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday. Given she wrote 5 articles on Tuesday, she wrote \(2 \times 5\).

Let's calculate these:

**Monday**: \(5\) articles

**Tuesday**: \(5 + \frac{2}{5} \times 5 = 5 + 2 = 7\) articles

**Wednesday**: \(2 \times 5 = 10\) articles

Now, let's add up all the articles written in the three days:

Total articles = \(5 + 7 + 10 = 22\) articles

Since it takes her 4 hours to write one article:

Total time spent = \(22 \times 4 = 88\) hours

Therefore, Meredith spent a total of 88 hours writing articles over the three days."
"To find out how many post-it notes Candice had initially (before purchasing the additional ones), we first need to calculate the total number of post-it notes she used:

She placed 220 post-it notes on cups of coffee.

So, she had \(220\) post-it notes after placing them on the coffee cups.

We know she also had \(80\) post-it notes before buying any extra ones. Therefore, before adding the new ones, she must have had \(80 + 220 = 300\) post-it notes.

If she had \(23\) post-it notes remaining overall, then the number of post-it notes in the package she purchased was \(300 - 23 = 277\).

Therefore, Candice purchased a package containing \(277\) post-it notes."
"1) John bought 2 blue ties because it says ""John buys twice as many red ties as blue ties"" so he bought 2 times the number of blue ties.
2) The red ties cost 50% more than the blue ones which means the price of a red tie is 1.5 times the price of a blue one. We know that a blue tie costs $40 so the price of a red tie would be 40*1.5=$60.
3) John bought 2 blue ties and each cost $40 so he spent 2*$40=$80 on blue ties.
4) The amount he spent on red ties is equal to the price of all the red ties combined. Since each red tie costs $60 and he bought 2 of them we can find the total price by multiplying $60 by 2.
5) The total price he paid for the red ties is $120.
6) The total amount he spent on all the ties was $200 because we know that he spent $200 on blue ties and $120 on red ties.
The answer is 120."
"1) Tracy's wire is 4 feet long. Since 1 foot equals 12 inches, then 4 feet equals 4 x 12 = 48 inches.
2) The wire is cut into pieces 6 inches long. Thus, we divide the total length by the length of each piece: 48 / 6 = 8 pieces.
The answer is 8."
"1) The building has 15 x 8 = 120 units.
2) Richard's building is 120 x 3/4 = 90 units occupied.

"To calculate how much Lloyd makes from selling eggs per week, we first need to find out how many dozens of eggs he sells in a week, then multiply by the price per dozen, and finally multiply by seven (the number of days in a week).

Given:
- The daily production rate of eggs: 252 eggs/day
- Price per dozen: $2

First, let's find out how many dozens are produced daily:

\[ \text{Dozens per day} = \frac{\text{Eggs per day}}{\text{Dozen}} = \frac{252}{12} = 21 \]

Since he sells these eggs for $2 per dozen, the weekly revenue from eggs sold is:

\[ \text{Weekly Revenue} = \text{Daily Revenue} \times \text{Days per Week} = 21 \times 7 = \$147 \]

Therefore, Lloyd makes $147 on eggs per week."
"1) Tom needs to travel 3 hours to get from 1 to 4 pm because 4 - 1 = 3

The answer is 6."
"To find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove, let's first calculate the weight of the comic books and then subtract this weight from the total weight he wants to reduce.

1. The weight of one comic book is \( \frac{1}{4} \) pound.
2. If Uriah removes 30 comic books, the total weight of the comic books removed is \( 30 \times \frac{1}{4} = 7.5 \) pounds.

Since we know Uriah wants to reduce the weight by 15 pounds, and the weight of the comic books removed equals 7.5 pounds, we can find out the total weight of the comics before removing them by adding this amount back to the 15 pounds he wants to reduce:

\[ 15 + 7.5 = 22.5 \] pounds

This means the total weight of the toys is the remaining weight after subtracting the weight of the comic books, which is:

\[ 22.5 - 7.5 = 15 \] pounds

Since each toy weighs \( \frac{1}{2} \) pound, the number of toys Uriah needs to remove (to reach the 15-pound goal) is:

\[ \frac{15}{\frac{1}{2}} = 15 \times 2 = 30 \]

Therefore, Uriah needs to remove 30 toys."
"To find out how much more revenue the mechanic earned on Thursday compared to Friday, we first need to calculate the earnings for both days.

For Thursday:

- Truck tires repaired: 6 tires × $60/tire = $360
- Car tires repaired: 4 tires × $40/tire = $160

Total earnings on Thursday = $360 (truck) + $160 (car) = $520

For Friday:

- No truck tires repaired
- Car tires repaired: 12 tires × $40/tire = $480

Total earnings on Friday = $480 (car)

Now, let's compare the earnings:

- Thursday earnings = $520
- Friday earnings = $480

Difference in earnings between Thursday and Friday = $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40

So, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday."
"1) The first cat, Patchy, has had 7/3 = 2.333 adopted kittens.
2) The second cat, Trixie, has had 12 kittens.
3) The total number of kittens that Patchy and Trixie have had is 2.333+12 = 14.333 kittens.
4) Since a kitten cannot be represented as a decimal value, we round it up to the nearest whole number, which is 15.
The answer is 15."

3) Therefore, Peter can go to the movies x times.
The answer is 3."
"To find out the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit, we first need to determine the total weight capacity of the truck.

Given that the truck weighs 3755 pounds and it carries a delivery box that weighs 15 pounds, the total weight of the truck when carrying one box would be \(15 \times 1\) (since each box weighs 15 pounds), making it 15 pounds.

Since the truck can carry up to 5000 pounds, the number of boxes that can fit within this weight limit is:

\[ \frac{5000}{15} = 333.33... \]

This means you could load 333 boxes into the truck. However, since you cannot load a fraction of a box, we must round down to the nearest whole number because you can't load part of a box into the truck. Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck while not exceeding the bridge's weight limit is 333."

"To find the total number of raspberries on the bush, we first calculate the total number of fruits inside the clusters and then add the number of individual fruit scattered across the bush.

Given:
- Each cluster contains 20 raspberries.
- There are 6 clusters.
- There are also 67 individual fruit scattered across the bush.

First, calculate the total number of raspberries inside the clusters:

\[ \text{Total raspberries inside clusters} = 6 \times 20 = 120 \]

Next, add the number of individual fruit scattered across the bush:

\[ \text{Total raspberries including scattered fruit} = 120 + 67 = 187 \]

Therefore, there are a total of 187 raspberries on the bush."
"To find out how many good oranges are in the basket, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Identify the number of unripe oranges**: Since 20% of the oranges are unripe, we calculate this by multiplying the total number of oranges (25) by 20%. This gives us \(25 \times 0.20 = 5\) unripe oranges.

2. **Determine the number of sour oranges**: We know that 2 oranges are sour, so no additional calculation is needed for this step.

3. **Calculate the number of good oranges**: To find the number of good oranges, we subtract all the other known quantities from the total number of oranges.

\[ \text{Total Good Oranges} = \text{Total Oranges} - (\text{Unripe Oranges} + \text{Sour Oranges}) \]

\[ \text{Total Good Oranges} = 25 - (5 + 2) = 25 - 7 = 18 \]

So, there are 18 good oranges in the basket."

"1) The initial amount for the first half of the year is 140 * 2 = $280.
2) The streaming company charged her 10% less money on the second half of the year, which is 10/100 * 280 = $28 less.
3) Therefore, the second half of the year cost her 280 - 28 = $252.
4) By the end of the year, Aleena had paid 280 + 252 = $532 for the streaming service.
The answer is 532."
"To find out how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we first need to determine the mileage per gallon (MPG). We're told that Sophia needs to put in 4 gallons of gas to refill her tank, and her car's manual states that her tank holds 12 gallons of gas. 

First, let's calculate the total distance covered by the car when it's full:

\[ \text{Total distance} = \text{Tank capacity} \times \text{Number of gallons in tank} \]
\[ \text{Total distance} = 12 \, \text{gallons} \times 4 \, \text{gallons} = 48 \, \text{miles} \]

This total distance includes both the initial 100 miles driven and the additional 48 miles required to refill the tank. However, the question asks about driving on one tank of gas alone. Since the additional 48 miles were driven while the tank was empty, these 48 miles don't contribute to the miles Sophia can drive on one tank.

Therefore, Sophia can drive \(48\) miles on a single tank of gas, considering only the miles covered during the initial journey and the distance needed to refill the tank."
"1) Jim watches TV for 2 hours per night.
2) He goes to bed and reads for half as long as he watches TV, so he reads for 2/2 = 1 hour per night.
3) He does this 3 nights a week, so he spends 3*2+3*1=12 hours per week on TV and reading.
4) He does this for 4 weeks, so he spends 4*12=48 hours in total.

"1) Each girl's team has 5 players and each boy's team has 5 players, which totals to 5 + 5 = 10 players per team.
2) Since each school has sent a girls' basketball team and a boys' basketball team, each school has sent 2 teams * 10 players/team = 20 players.
3) Since each team has 5 players on their own, this means each school has sent 20 players + 1 coach/player = 21 people.
4) Since there are 4 schools competing, then the total number of people from these schools would be 21 people/school * 4 schools = 84 people.
The answer is 84."

"To find out how much money Bailey started with before receiving the weekly allowance, we need to calculate the total amount she received over the 8 weeks from her allowance.

She receives a weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks, which amounts to:

\[ \text{Total allowance} = \$5 \times 8 = \$40 \]

Given that this total amount is enough to reach the end balance of $100, it implies that she must have started with:

\[ \text{Starting amount} = \text{End balance} - \text{Total allowance} \]
\[ \text{Starting amount} = \$100 - \$40 = \$60 \]

Therefore, Bailey started with $60 before receiving the weekly allowance of $5 for 8 weeks."

"To find out how much Artie will make in total, we first need to calculate the revenue from each type of flower and then add them together.

1. Marigolds: Artie sells 12 pots of marigolds at $2.74 per pot. 
\[ \text{Revenue from marigolds} = 12 \times \$2.74 = \$33.68 \]

2. Petunias: Artie sells 9 pots of petunias at $1.87 per pot. 
\[ \text{Revenue from petunias} = 9 \times \$1.87 = \$17.83 \]

3. Begonias: Artie sells 17 pots of begonias at $2.12 per pot. 
\[ \text{Revenue from begonias} = 17 \times \$2.12 = \$35.04 \]

"To find out how much Vincent saves by choosing the better option, we first need to calculate the cost of purchasing 18 flowers using both options:

### Option 1 (Buying in Packages of 3):
Cost per flower when bought in packs of 3: $2.50 / 3 = $0.833

Total cost for 18 flowers: \(18 \times \$0.833\) = $15.00

### Option 2 (Buying in Packs of 2):
Cost per flower when bought in packs of 2: $1 / 2 = $0.50

Total cost for 18 flowers: \(18 \times \$0.50\) = $9.00

### Savings:
Savings = Total cost at lower price - Total cost at higher price
Savings = $15.00 - $9.00 = $6.00

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by choosing the better option of buying 18 flowers at a price point of $1.00 per flower."

- From the store: 21 stickers
- From his birthday: 23 stickers
- From giving to his sister: 9 stickers
- From decorating the greeting card: 28 stickers

Adding these together gives us the total number of stickers Charlie has before any are used or given away:

\[21 + 23 + 9 + 28\]

Now, let's calculate this sum:

\[21 + 23 + 9 + 28 = 81\]

"1) To find out how much Alex weighs, we first need to calculate four times Grace's weight. Since Grace weighs 125 pounds, four times that amount would be \(4 \times 125 = 500\) pounds.

Next, we know that Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this value. Therefore, Alex's weight is \(500 - 2 = 498\) pounds.

To find their combined weight, we add Grace's weight to Alex's weight: \(125 + 498 = 623\) pounds.

So, their combined weight is 623 pounds.
The answer is $\boxed{623}$."

"1) In a year, the company increases the salary of an employee by 10% of $600, which equals 600 * 0.1 = $60.
2) Thus, Sylvie's salary increased by $60 in the first year, making it $600 + $60 = $660.
3) The same happens again in the next year, meaning Sylvie's salary will increase by another $60.
4) Therefore, Sylvie's salary will increase by $60 * 2 = $120 per year.
5) Since Sylvie has already worked for 5 years, she will receive a total of $120 * 5 = $600 increase over her original salary.
6) Adding this increase to her original salary of $600, we get $600 + $600 = $1200 as her salary after three more years of service.
The answer is $1200."
" Let's say Harald sold $x$ copies. Then Marilyn sold $10x$ copies. The total number of copies sold is $x + 10x = 11x$. We know that this sum equals 88,000, so we have the equation $11x = 88000$.
To solve for $x$, we divide both sides of the equation by 11: $x = \frac{88000}{11} = 8000$.
So Harald sold 8000 copies.

"To find out how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we first need to calculate how many guests showed up, then determine how many gift bags she needs based on this number, and finally multiply by the cost of each gift bag.

1. **Calculate the number of guests who showed up:** Since 1/4 of the attendees don't show up, this means 3/4 (or 0.75 in decimal form) of the guests actually attend the party. Given she invited 16 friends, the number of guests who showed up is \(16 \times 0.75 = 12\) guests.

2. **Determine the number of gift bags needed:** Since Christina plans to give each of these guests one gift bag, and there are 12 guests attending, she needs \(12\) gift bags.

3. **Calculate the cost of the gift bags:** Each gift bag costs $2, so the total cost for all 12 gift bags would be \(12 \times \$2 = \$24\).

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags for the party."
"To find out how many pounds of potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we first determine the amount needed per person based on their age group:

1. **Adults**: An adult dinosaur eats 10 lbs of potato salad.
2. **Children**: A child will eat half as much as an adult, which means a child eats \( \frac{1}{2} \times 10 \) lbs = 5 lbs of potato salad.

Next, we calculate the total weight of potato salad required for all the adults and children combined:

- For the adults: \( 20 \text{ adults} \times 10 \text{ lbs/adult} = 200 \text{ lbs} \)
- For the children: \( 5 \text{ children} \times 5 \text{ lbs/child} = 25 \text{ lbs} \)

Adding these together gives us the total weight of potato salad required:

\( 200 \text{ lbs (adults)} + 25 \text{ lbs (children)} = 225 \text{ lbs} \)

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to have enough to feed everyone."

"To solve this problem, let's first find out how long it takes Gerald to run the 400 meters before his improvement.

Given that Lee runs the 400 meters in 38 seconds, we know that Gerald, running two seconds slower, would take \(38 + 2 = 40\) seconds.

Now, let's consider Gerald's improvement. If his new speed is 10% faster, we need to calculate what 10% of his original time (40 seconds) represents.

\[ \text{Improvement} = \frac{\text{Original Time}}{100}\times\text{Percentage Increase} \]

\[ \text{Improvement} = \frac{40}{100} \times 10\% = \frac{40}{100} \times \frac{10}{100} = \frac{40}{1000} = 0.04 \]

So, Gerald's speed increased by 4%.

With his improved speed, Gerald will run the 400 meters in:

\[ 40 + (40 \times 0.04) = 40 + 1.6 = 41.6 \] seconds.

Therefore, with his improved diet, Gerald can run the 400-meter hurdles in 41.6 seconds.
The answer is $\boxed{41.6}$."
"1) The number of cats is twice as many as the dogs because it says ""two cats for every dog"". Therefore, there are 2*60=120 cats.
2) The combined number of pets dogs and cats is 120+60=180.

"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we first need to determine how many cans of tomatoes she used based on the amount of sauce she produced. 

Given that each can contains 3 tomatoes and Freda's last batch of sauce was 32 ounces, we can calculate the number of cans as follows:

\[ \text{Number of cans} = \frac{\text{Total ounces of sauce}}{\text{Cans per ounce}} = \frac{32}{16} = 2 \]

So, Freda used 2 cans of tomatoes.

Since each can contains 3 tomatoes, the total number of tomatoes used is:

\[ \text{Total tomatoes} = \text{Number of cans} \times \text{Topples per can} = 2 \times 3 = 6 \]

Therefore, Freda used 6 tomatoes.
The answer is $\boxed{6}$."

"1) Jerome had 4 friends visiting him. This includes himself and the other three friends.
2) The fourth friend pressed on the doorbell 60 times.
3) The third friend pressed on the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend, which means the third friend pressed 60 + 10 = 70 times.
4) The second friend pressed on the doorbell 1/4 times more than Jerome's first friend, meaning the second friend pressed 20 + (1/4)*20 = 20 + 5 = 25 times.
5) The first friend pressed on the doorbell 20 times.
6) Therefore, the total number of doorbell rings made by all the friends is 60 + 70 + 25 + 20 = 175.

"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to calculate the area of the city covered by the fog bank. The fog bank covers the entire city, which is 42 miles across from the oceanfront to the opposite inland edge.

Given that it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles, we can calculate the time required to cover one mile as follows:

\[ \text{Time per mile} = \frac{\text{Time}}{\text{Miles per Time}} = \frac{10 \text{ minutes}}{3 \text{ miles}} = \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes/mile} \]

Now, since the city is 42 miles wide, the time taken to cover the entire city would be:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Area of City} \times \text{Time per Mile} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = 42 \text{ miles} \times \frac{10}{3} \text{ minutes/mile} = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city.

\[\boxed{140 \text{ minutes}}\]"

The answer is 666.67."
"To find out how many cookies Cody eats compared to Amir, we set up a proportion based on the information given:

Let \(x\) represent the number of cookies Amir eats.

According to the problem, Cody eats three times as many cookies as Amir, so we have:
\[ \frac{x}{5} = \frac{3x}{5} \]

This equation tells us that the ratio of the number of cookies Amir eats to the number of cookies Cody eats is equal to 3 (or 1.5 when considering the fractions).

Now, let's solve for \(x\):
\[ x = 5 \times 1.5 = 7.5 \]

So, Amir eats 7.5 cookies.

Together, they eat \(7.5 + 5 = 12.5\) cookies.

Therefore, together they eat 12.5 cookies.

2) He watches 1 hour on Thursday and another 1 hour on Friday, totaling 2 hours.
3) He watches a total of 2 + 1 + 1 + 2 = 6 hours of TV over Monday through Friday.
4) Since he watched 7 hours of TV in total, this leaves 7 - 6 = 1 hour of TV to be watched on Saturday or Sunday.
5) Since he watches an hour on Saturday or Sunday, he must have watched 1/2 = 0.5 hour of TV on Wednesday.
6) This means he watched 30 minutes of TV on Wednesday, since there are 60 minutes in an hour.

"To find out how many fruits they ate on average, we need to calculate the number of fruits (or roll-ups) each person ate and then divide by the number of people (which is 2 in this case).

For Beatrice:
- The length of her roll-up is 24 rolls long.
- Her width is 2 roll-ups wide.
- Therefore, the area of her roll-up is \(2 \times 24 = 48\) square units.

Since each roll-up is considered one unit, Beatrice ate \(48 / 1 = 48\) roll-ups.

For Marcell:
- The length of his roll-up is 14 rolls long.
- His width is 3 roll-ups wide.
- Therefore, the area of his roll-up is \(3 \times 14 = 42\) square units.

Again, since each roll-up is considered one unit, Marcell ate \(42 / 1 = 42\) roll-ups.

Now, to find the average number of fruits (or roll-ups) each person ate:

- Beatrice ate an average of \(48 \div 2 = 24\) roll-ups per person.
- Marcell ate an average of \(42 \div 2 = 21\) roll-ups per person.

So, on average, they ate 24 roll-ups per person.

"To find out how many flowers Ryan planted in total after 15 days, we first need to calculate how many flowers he actually grew.

Given that Ryan plants 2 flowers per day for 15 days:

\[ \text{Total flowers grown} = 2 \times 15 = 30 \]

Now, it's given that 5 flowers didn't grow. Therefore, the number of flowers that did grow is:

\[ \text{Flowers that grew} = \text{Total flowers grown} - 5 = 30 - 5 = 25 \]

So, Ryan has 25 flowers in his garden after planting for 15 days."
"1) If Jamal's phone can hold 6 times more photographs than Brittany's phone, then if Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs, then Brittany's phone can hold 1800/6 = 300 photographs.
2) If the maximum number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 50 times more than the number of birds in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo, then the number of birds in Jamal's photograph would be (300-50)/50 = 50.
3) If there are 50 birds in Jamal's photograph, and we know that the number of photographs that Brittany's phone can hold is 300, then the number of ducks in Jamal's photograph would be 1800/(300+50) = 1800/350 = 5.

"To calculate the total profit Sasha makes by selling the lumber, we need to first determine the new price per board after a 50% increase.

Original price per board (without any increase): $10

Increase in price due to 50% increase: \(10 \times 0.50 = \$5\)

New price per board after increase: \(10 + 5 = \$15\)

Now, let's calculate the total revenue from selling the 10 2x4x10 boards:

Revenue from 10 2x4x10 boards = \(10 \times 2 \times 10 \times 15\) cents = \(20 \times 10 \times 15\) cents = \(3000\) cents or $30

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the five 4x4x10 boards:

Cost of 5 4x4x10 boards = \(5 \times 4 \times 10 \times 16\) cents = \(200 \times 16\) cents = $320

Finally, let's find out the profit made by subtracting the total cost from the total revenue:

Profit = Revenue - Cost = \(30 - 320\) cents = -$290 cents or -$2.90

Therefore, despite the 50% increase in the price of the lumber, Sasha does not make a profit; instead, she incurs a loss of $2.90."
"To find out the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we first need to understand what ""teaspoonfuls"" mean. In this context, it likely refers to the amount of sugar per cup of water. The ratio given for the amount of sugar to the amount of water is 7:13. This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

Given that Katy used a total of 120 teaspoons of sugar (which is equivalent to 120 * 7/10 = 84 teaspoons), let's denote the total number of parts as \(P\). Therefore, since 7 parts correspond to 84 teaspoons, one part would correspond to \(84 / 7 = 12\) teaspoons.

Since the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, for every 13 parts (and hence, 13 * 12 = 156 teaspoons) of water, there are 7 parts (and hence, 7 * 12 = 84 teaspoons) of sugar.

Therefore, if Katy used 120 teaspoons in total, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar she used (\(x\)) can be calculated by dividing the total amount of sugar used by the number of parts for sugar:

\[x = \frac{84}{13} = 6\]

So, Katy used 6 teaspoonfuls of sugar.
The answer is $\boxed{6}$."

"To find out how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we first need to determine how many sheets he uses per week and then multiply by the number of weeks in a month.

He uses 2 pads of paper a week, and each pad contains 30 sheets. 

So, the total number of sheets used per week is \(2 \times 30\).

\(2 \times 30 = 60\) sheets per week.

Since there are approximately 4 weeks in a month (considering the typical length of a month), the total number of sheets used every month would be \(60 \times 4\).

\(60 \times 4 = 240\) sheets.

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper every month."

"1) Rosie can run 10 x 3 = 30 miles before she slows down.
2) Rosie can run another 5 x T = 5T miles.
3) Since we know that she ran 30 miles already, then 30 + 5T = 7 hours.
4) Solve for T by subtracting 30 from both sides: 5T = 7 - 30 = -23.
5) Divide both sides by 5: T = -23/5 = -4.6.
6) However, time cannot be negative, so Rosie can't run for a negative amount of time.
7) Therefore, Rosie will run 30 miles in 7 hours.

"To find out how many letters were in the pile when Jennie began, we need to calculate how many letters she put in the already-stamped pile and then add it back to the original number of letters needing stamps.

Jennie put stamps on \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the letters needing stamps, which means she put stamps on \( 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 20 \) letters.

So, the number of letters in the pile before she put stamps on them was \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

Since there are now 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters, this number represents the sum of the letters in the pile before she put stamps on them and the letters she put in the already-stamped pile. Therefore, the original number of letters needing stamps (which includes both those already stamped and those still needing stamps) is \( 40 + 30 = 70 \).

Jennie had 60 letters needing stamps initially, so there must have been \( 60 - 70 = -10 \) letters in the pile when she began, indicating that there were actually less than 60 letters in the pile before she started, which doesn't make sense in the context of the problem statement as there would not be enough letters to satisfy the conditions given.

It seems there might be a misunderstanding or an error in the interpretation of the question. The correct calculation should account for all the letters needing stamps including the ones already in the pile. Let's re-evaluate:

Given the information provided, if Jennie put stamps on \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the letters needing stamps, she didn't mention anything about the letters already in the pile being counted towards the total number needing stamps. However, since she put stamps on \( \frac{1}{3} \) of the letters needing stamps, we can assume she also put stamps on the letters already in the pile, which means the number of letters in the pile before she put stamps on them remains unchanged.

Therefore, the original number of letters needing stamps was \( 60 \), and since she put stamps on \( \frac{1}{3} \) of these, the remaining letters needing stamps is \( 60 - 60 \times \frac{1}{3} = 60 - 20 = 40 \). 

This matches our previous calculation, confirming that there were indeed 40 letters needing stamps initially, making the total number of letters needing stamps 60.

If there were no additional information or clarification about whether the already-stamped letters are part of the 60 letters needing stamps, the initial count of 60 would remain valid based on the information provided. However, without further context, it's unclear what ""already-stamped"" refers to."

"To find out how much money Dillon will spend on watermelons, we first need to determine the cost per watermelon. Since a watermelon costs three times what each pepper costs, and each pepper costs $15, then:

Cost of one watermelon = 3 * $15 = $45

Dillon wants to buy 4 watermelons, so the total cost for the watermelons is:

Total cost for watermelons = 4 * $45 = $180

Next, let's calculate the cost for the peppers. Each pepper costs $15, and Dillon buys 20 of them, so:

Total cost for peppers = 20 * $15 = $300

Now, we know that an orange costs $5 less than what a watermelon costs, which means:

Cost of one orange = Cost of one watermelon - $5 = $45 - $5 = $40

Dillon buys 10 oranges, so the total cost for the oranges is:

Total cost for oranges = 10 * $40 = $400

Finally, to find out the total amount of money Dillon spends on all these purchases, we add up the costs of the watermelons, peppers, and oranges:

Total amount spent = Total cost for watermelons + Total cost for peppers + Total cost for oranges
Total amount spent = $180 + $300 + $400 = $880

Therefore, Dillon will spend a total of $880 on the 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges."
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to first determine the total number of hours worked by the doctors and then compare it to the revenue generated by the patients.

1. **Calculating Hours Worked by Doctors:**
   - Each patient is seen for an average of 24 minutes.
   - Since there are 500 patients per day, this translates to \(500 \times 24\) minutes.
   - Converting minutes into hours (since there are 60 minutes in an hour), we get \(500 \times 24 / 60 = 100\) hours.

2. **Revenue Generated by Patients:**
   - The patients pay $200 per hour.
   - Therefore, the total revenue from patients is \(100 \times \$200 = \$20,000\).

3. **Costs Incurred by the Hospital:**
   - The doctors charge $150 per hour.
   - Therefore, the total costs incurred by the hospital for the doctors' services is \(100 \times \$150 = \$15,000\).

4. **Profit Calculation:**
   - Profit is calculated as revenue minus costs.
   - Profit = Revenue - Costs
   - Profit = \$20,000 - \$15,000

Therefore, the hospital makes a profit of $5,000 from these visits."

"To find Joseph's total expenditure over the two months, we first calculate his June expenditure and then add it to his May expenditure.

1. **Expenditure in May:** $500

2. **Expenditure in June:** $60 less than May's expenditure. Therefore, his June expenditure would be:

   \(May's \ Expenditure - $60 = June's \ Expenditure\)

   \(500 - 60 = 440\)

So, Joseph's June expenditure is $440.

3. **Total Expenditure for Both Months:**

   To find the total expenditure for both months, we add May's expenditure ($500) to June's expenditure ($440):

   \(May's \ Expenditure + June's \ Expenditure = Total \ Expenditure\)

   \(500 + 440 = 940\)

Therefore, Joseph's total expenditure for those two months is $940.

"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we first need to determine how far he walked on Tuesday compared to Monday.

Given:
- On Monday, Walt walked 4 miles.
- On Tuesday, he walked 6 times as many miles as he walked on Monday.
- His total mileage for Monday through Wednesday (Monday + Tuesday + Wednesday) was 41 miles.

Let's denote the distance Walt walked on Tuesday as \(T\). Since he walked 6 times as much on Tuesday as he did on Monday, we can write this relationship as:
\[T = 6 \times 4\]

Now let's calculate the total distance walked by adding the distances walked on Monday, Tuesday, and Wednesday:

\[Total \, Distance = 4 + T + Wednesday\]

We know the total distance is 41 miles, so:
\[4 + T + Wednesday = 41\]

Substituting the expression for \(T\) into the equation gives us:
\[4 + 6 \times 4 + Wednesday = 41\]
\[4 + 24 + Wednesday = 41\]
\[28 + Wednesday = 41\]
\[Wednesday = 41 - 28\]

Therefore, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we first need to calculate how many times he actually washes his own car per month.

He gets 4 car washes a month.

Since each car wash costs $15, the total amount he spends on car washes per month is:

\[4 \times \$15 = \$60\]

Now, to find out how much he pays in a year (which is 12 months), we multiply the monthly cost by 12:

\[\$60 \times 12 = \$720\]

Therefore, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"1) Brian had 20 video games, but he lost 5, leaving him with 20 - 5 = 15 video games.
2) Bobby has 5 fewer than 3 times what Brian has, which is 3*15 - 5 = 45 - 5 = 40 video games.

"To find out what percentage of the cars are semi-automatic, we first need to determine the number of semi-automatic cars among the remaining options:

Total cars = Automatic cars + Manual cars + Semi-automatic cars

Given:
Automatic cars = 12
Manual cars = 4

Let's calculate the number of semi-automatic cars first:
Semi-automatic cars = Total cars - (Automatic cars + Manual cars)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - (12 + 4)
Semi-automatic cars = 20 - 16
Semi-automatic cars = 4

Now, let's calculate the percentage of semi-automatic cars based on the total number of cars:
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (Number of semi-automatic cars / Total number of cars) × 100%
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = (4 / 20) × 100%
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 0.2 × 100%
Percentage of semi-automatic cars = 20%

Therefore, 20% of the cars are semi-automatic."
"Let's denote:

- The number of worker bees as \(W\)
- The number of baby bees as \(B\)
- The number of queen bees as \(Q\)

From the problem statement, we know that:

1. There are twice as many worker bees as baby bees: \(W = 2B\).
2. There are twice as many babies as queens: \(B = 2Q\).

We also know that the total number of bees is 700, which includes both workers, babies, and queens:

\[W + B + Q = 700\]

Substituting \(B\) and \(Q\) from the above equations into the total equation gives us:

\[W + (2Q) + 2Q = 700\]
\[W + 3Q = 700\]

Since we already know \(W = 2B\) and \(B = 2Q\), let's substitute these values back into our new equation:

\[2B + 3Q = 700\]

Now, since we don't have enough information about \(B\) or \(Q\) directly, we need another piece of information. However, given the nature of the problem, it seems there might be an error in the setup or interpretation of the question because the total number of bees is not dependent on knowing the exact numbers of worker bees (\(W\)) and baby bees (\(B\)). 

If we assume the total number of bees is indeed related to the number of worker bees, then we would need additional information to solve for \(W\). Without this, we cannot determine the number of worker bees based solely on the given information.

Please check if there's a mistake in the question or if there's any other relevant information provided. If there isn't enough information to proceed, please clarify the context or provide additional details to assist you better."
"1) Jordan plays video games for 2 hours per day, so over 7 days he plays a total of 2*7 = 14 hours.
2) He earns $10 an hour at work, so in 14 hours he would earn 10*14 = $140.
The answer is 140."
"To find out how much everything cost including the tax, we first calculate the total cost of all food items before tax:

Milk: $2
Eggs: $3
Light Bulbs: $3
Cups: $3
Roach Traps: $4

Total cost of food items = $2 + $3 + $3 + $3 + $4 = $15

Next, we calculate the tax on non-food items (which are the light bulbs and roach traps):

Tax on non-food items = 10% of $3 for light bulbs + 10% of $4 for roach traps

Tax on non-food items = 0.10 * ($3 + $4) = 0.10 * $7 = $0.7

So, the total tax amount is $0.7.

Finally, we add the tax to the total cost of the food items to get the final cost:

Final cost = Total cost of food items + Tax on non-food items

Final cost = $15 + $0.7 = $15.7

Therefore, the total cost including the 10% tax on non-food items is $15.7."
"To calculate Kim's profit, we first need to determine his total expenses.

He has 3 current clients who will require 2 bottles of bleach each and one pack of cloths. This totals \(3 \times (2 + 1) = 3 \times 3 = 9\) bottles of bleach and packs of cloths.

Each bottle of bleach costs $2, so the total cost for the bleach is \(9 \times \$2 = \$18\).

Each pack of cloths costs $5, so the total cost for the cloths is \(9 \times \$5 = \$45\).

Adding these together gives us the total expense:

Total expense = Cost of bleach + Cost of cloths
Total expense = \$18 + \$45 = \$63

Now, let's calculate his profit:

Profit = Total income - Total expense
Profit = $92 - $63 = $29

Therefore, Kim will make a profit of $29 each week."
"To find out how many pineapples John can harvest within a year, we first need to determine how many pineapples he grows in one month, then multiply by 12 since there are 12 months in a year.

John starts with 10 hectares and each hectare produces 100 pineapples. So, the total number of pineapples produced in one month (30 days) would be:

\[10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/hectare} \times \frac{30}{31} \text{ days/half month}\]

Since there are 31 days in a month, we divide by 31 because half of a month is counted as half an hour, not a full hour. This gives us:

\[100 \times \frac{30}{31} \approx 98.46\]

Rounding down to the nearest whole number because you can't have a fraction of a pineapple, we get approximately 98 pineapples per month.

Over a year (which is 12 months), John will therefore harvest:

\[98 \text{ pineapples/month} \times 12 \text{ months/year} = 1176 \text{ pineapples/year}\]

So, John can harvest 1176 pineapples within a year."
"1) The second box was 3 times as many pieces as the first one, meaning it had 3 * 500 = 1500 pieces.
2) The third box had 1/4 as many pieces as the first one, which meant it had 500 / 4 = 125 pieces.
3) In total, he picked up 500 + 1500 + 125 = 2125 pieces.

4) Three pigeons ate a total of 3*3 = 9 french fries.
5) This left Dave with 7 - 9 = 2 french fries.
6) A raccoon took two thirds of the remaining fries, which is (2/3)*2 = 1.333 french fries.
7) This left Dave with 2 - 1.333 = 0.667 french fries.
8) Ants removed one french fry, leaving 0.667 - 1 = -0.333 french fries.
9) This means that Dave actually had 0 french fries when he bought them.

"1) On Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays, Kimo has 3 classes each day, which means a total of 3 * 1 = 3 hours per day.
Since this happens every day for those three days, it adds up to 3 * 3 = 9 hours per week on these days.
2) On Tuesdays and Thursdays, Kimo has 2 classes each day, which means a total of 2 * 2 = 4 hours per day.
Again, this happens every day for those two days, adding up to 4 * 2 = 8 hours per week on those days.
3) Therefore, the total number of hours Kimo spends attending class in one week is 9 + 8 = 17 hours.
4) Since there are 16 weeks in a semester, Kimo will spend 17 * 16 = 272 hours attending classes in a semester.
The answer is 272."
"To find out how long the rolled, croissant, and baguette items would be if put end-to-end, we first need to convert everything into consistent units:

1 inch equals approximately 2.54 centimeters (since 1 foot equals 12 inches).

So, the length of one roll would be \(4 \times 2.54 = 10.16\) centimeters or 0.1016 meters.

Each croissant would then be \(6 \times 2.54 = 15.24\) centimeters or 0.1524 meters.

And each baguette would be \(2 \times 2.54 = 5.08\) centimeters or 0.0508 meters.

Now, let's calculate the total length:

- Rolled: \(300 \times 0.1016 = 305.48\) cm or 3.0548 meters.
- Croissants: \(120 \times 0.1524 = 183.08\) cm or 1.8308 meters.
- Baguettes: \(60 \times 0.0508 = 3.048\) cm or 0.3048 meters.

Adding them together gives us the total length:

\[3.0548 + 1.8308 + 0.3048 = 5.1914\] meters.

Therefore, when all the baked goods are put end-to-end, they would be a total of 5.1914 meters long.
The answer is $\boxed{5.1914}$."

"To find out how far each person ran, we need to calculate the distance covered by both Blake and Kelly based on their running patterns.

For Blake:

Blake runs back and forth 15 times, each time covering 100 yards (since the football field is 100 yards long). Therefore, the total distance Blake covers is \(15 \times 100 = 1500\) yards.

Kelly's pattern involves running to the other side of the field (40 yards away), which she repeats 34 times. Since she ends up back where she started (the 40-yard line), this effectively doubles her distance because she covers the same path twice. This means Kelly covers \(40 \times 34 = 1360\) yards.

Adding these distances together gives us the total distance each person covered:

- Blake: \(1500\)
- Kelly: \(1360 + 1360 = 2720\)

Now, to find out how much farther the winner (in this case, Kelly) ran than the loser (Blake), we subtract the distance Blake ran from the distance Kelly ran:

\(2720 - 1500 = 1220\)

Therefore, the winner, Kelly, ran 1220 yards farther than the loser, Blake."
"To find out how much Raphael spent on all the school supplies, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then sum them up.

For the pens:
- Each pen costs $1.5, and Raphael bought 4 of them.
- Total cost for pens = \(4 \times \$1.5\)

For the notebooks:
- Each notebook costs $4, and Raphael bought 2 of them.
- Total cost for notebooks = \(2 \times \$4\)

For the bond paper:
- The bond paper costs $20.

Now let's add these amounts together:

Total cost = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper

Let's calculate this step by step:

Cost of pens = \(4 \times \$1.5 = \$6\)

Cost of notebooks = \(2 \times \$4 = \$8\)

Cost of bond paper = \$20

Total cost = \$6 + \$8 + \$20 = \$34

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of $34 on all the school supplies."

"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin caught together, let's add up their individual totals:

- Anakin caught 10 starfish, 6 sea horses, and 3 clownfish. 
- Locsin caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin (10 - 5 = 5), 3 fewer sea horses than Ankinin (6 - 3 = 3), and 2 more clownfish than Anakin (3 + 2 = 5).

Now we add these amounts together to get the total number of fish both caught:

\[ \text{Total} = (\text{Anakin's starfish}) + (\text{Anakin's sea horses}) + (\text{Anakin's clownfish}) + (\text{Locsin's starfish}) + (\text{Locsin's sea horses}) + (\text{Locsin's clownfish}) \]

\[ \text{Total} = 33 \]

So, Anakin and Locsin were able to catch a total of 33 fish together."
"To find out how much a bag of marbles would cost after 36 months, we need to consider the increase in price based on the given scenario:

1. The initial cost of the bag of marbles is $20.
2. The price increases by 20% every two months.
3. We're looking for the cost after 36 months (which is twice as long as one cycle).

Let's calculate the cost incrementally over time.

**First Two Months:**
- Increase: $20 \times 20\% = $20 \times 0.20 = $4
- New Price: $20 + $4 = $24

**Next Two Months:**
- Increase: $24 \times 20\% = $24 \times 0.20 = $4.80
- New Price: $24 + $4.80 = $28.80

**Third Month:** No additional increase because it's already increased twice since the first month.

**Fourth Month:** Again, no additional increase because it's already increased three times since the second month.

**Fifth Month:** No additional increase because it's already increased four times since the third month.

**Sixth Month:** Another increase of $4.80.

So, by the end of six months, the cost would be $28.80 + $4.80 = $33.60.

Therefore, after 36 months, a bag of marbles would cost $33.60."
"1) We know that one red car costs $4. Since there are 5 red cars, then we know that 5 * $4 = $20 worth of red cars.
2) The doll costs as much as 3 action figures. So if one action figure costs $5, then the doll would cost 3 * $5 = $15.
3) Now we need to add up all the values of the action figures and the dolls. The value of the dolls is $15 and the value of the action figures is $15. So their sum is $15 + $15 = $30.
The answer is 30."
"To find out how much more money Jackie will have if she hires the accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, let's first calculate how much she would earn by doing her taxes herself:

If Jackie doesn't hire an accountant, she will make \( \frac{35}{3} \times 35 \) dollars because she loses 3 hours of work (at $35 per hour), which equals \( \frac{35}{3} \times 35 = 35 \times 11.666... = \$425 \).

Next, we need to figure out how much she would earn by hiring an accountant:

The accountant charges $90, so if she makes this amount, she will lose $425 ($90 - $425 = -$335). Since it's not possible to lose money, this indicates a mistake in our calculation. Let's correct this by understanding the context correctly:

Jackie needs to earn enough money to cover both the loss of income due to not being able to work as much and the cost of hiring the accountant.

Since she's earning $35 per hour working and she will lose $35 per hour when she doesn't work, she needs to earn back $35 * 3 hours = $105 to break even. This includes both the lost income and the cost of the tax preparation.

Therefore, the net amount she will gain by hiring the accountant, compared to doing her taxes herself, is $105.

So, if she earns $105, she will have \( \$105 - \$90 = \$15 \) more than if she does her taxes herself.

" Let's say Brooke's current age is $x$. Then Seth's current age is $2x$ because Seth is twice as old as Brooke.
In 2 years, Brooke will be $x+2$ and Seth will be $2x+2$.
According to the problem, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28, so we can write the equation:
\[(x+2) + (2x+2) = 28.\]
Combining like terms gives us:
\[3x + 4 = 28.\]
Subtracting 4 from both sides gives us:
\[3x = 24.\]
Dividing both sides by 3 gives us:
\[x = 8.\]
So Brooke is currently 8 years old.
To find Seth's age, we substitute $x=8$ into the expression for Seth's age:
\[2x = 2(8) = 16.\]
So Seth is currently 16 years old.
The answer is $\boxed{16}$."
"To find out how much money Jimmy has, we first need to determine how much money Ethel has based on the information given.

Ethel has $8.

Since Jimmy has $2 more than twice the amount of money Ethel has, we calculate:

Twice the amount of money Ethel has is \(2 \times \$8\).

Then, adding $2 to this result gives us the amount of money Jimmy has:

\(2 \times \$8 + \$2\)

Let's perform these calculations:

\(2 \times \$8 = \$16\)

Adding $2 to this gives us:

\$16 + \$2 = \$18

So, Jimmy has $18."

"To calculate Lloyd's earnings for the first two weeks, we need to multiply the number of hours he worked by his hourly rate and then sum up those earnings.

For the first week, he tutored for 5 hours at a rate of $10 per hour, so he earned \(5 \times \$10 = \$50\).

For the second week, he tutored for 8 hours at a rate of $10 per hour, so he earned \(8 \times \$10 = \$80\).

Adding these amounts together gives us the total amount he earned over the first two weeks:

\$50 (first week) + \$80 (second week) = \$130.

So, Lloyd earned a total of $130 for the first two weeks of tutoring.
The answer is $\boxed{130}$."
"1) The winner got 3/4 of the votes, which means the loser got 1/4 of the votes because the total votes must add up to one whole (since a fraction represents part of something).
2) In order to find out what fraction of the votes the loser got, we need to divide the fraction representing the votes the winner got by the fraction representing the votes the loser got.
3) So, the fraction representing the votes the winner got is 3/4, and the fraction representing the votes the loser got is 1/4.
4) To find the number of votes the loser got, we multiply the fractions together: (3/4) * (1/4) = 3/16.
5) Since the total number of votes was 80, we can set up an equation to solve for the number of votes the loser got: 80 * (1/4) = 3/16 * x, where x is the number of votes the loser got.
6) Solving this equation gives us: x = 80 * (1/4) / (3/16) = 160 / 3 = 53.33.
7) However, since the number of votes cannot be a decimal, we round it down to the nearest whole number.
8) Therefore, the number of votes the loser got is 53.
The answer is 53."
"1) Sandra had 200 pink calla lilies, which was 5 times the number of white carnations. Therefore, the number of white carnations is 200/5 = 40.
2) Sandra had 4 times as many red roses as white carnations. Therefore, the number of red roses is 4*40 = 160.
3) Since Sandra had ordered 200 pink calla lilies, this means Fred needs to deliver 160 red roses to make up for the missing ones.
The answer is 160."
"1) Let's denote Jan's current age as J and Mark's current age as M.
2) According to the problem, we know that Jean is two years older than Mark, which means that J = M + 2.
3) We also know that two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age. This means that M - 2 = (J - 2)/2.
4) Finally, if Jan is 30, then J = 30.
5) Substituting J = 30 into the equation M - 2 = (J - 2)/2, we get M - 2 = (30 - 2)/2 = 15.
6) Solving this equation for M gives us M = 15 + 2 = 17.
7) Now we can find Jean's age by substituting M = 17 into the equation J = M + 2, which gives us J = 17 + 2 = 19.
The answer is 19."
"1) The first team runs their leg in 55 seconds.
2) The second team's first runner runs in 60 seconds.
3) Their second runner runs in 57 seconds (which is 3 seconds less than the first).
4) Their third runner runs in 54 seconds (which is 3 seconds less than the second).
5) Their fourth runner runs in 51 seconds (which is 3 seconds less than the third).

To find out how long it takes for the first team to finish the race, we add up all the times: 55 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 229 seconds.

To find out how long it takes for the second team to finish the race, we also add up all the times: 60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 220 seconds.

So the first team finishes the race in 229 seconds while the second team finishes in 220 seconds. Therefore, the first team wins by 9 seconds.
The answer is 9."
"To find out how much more likely it is to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probability for each event separately and then compare them.

### Probability of Rolling a Number Greater Than 3

A six-sided die has numbers from 1 to 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Therefore, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes when rolling the die.

Probability of rolling a number greater than 3 = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

### Probability of Rolling Two Even Numbers in a Row

For this event, you would need to consider all possible combinations of two even numbers on the die. Since the die has 3 even numbers (2, 4, 6), there are 3 ways to choose which two even numbers will appear on your roll:

- Both even numbers could be 2 and 4.
- Both even numbers could be 2 and 6.
- Both even numbers could be 4 and 6.

So, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes when rolling the die twice.

Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row = Favorable outcomes / Total outcomes = 3/6 = 0.5 or 50%.

### Comparing the Probabilities

Now, let's compare the probabilities:

- Probability of rolling a number greater than 3: 50%
- Probability of rolling two even numbers in a row: 50%

Since both events are equally likely, the difference between these probabilities is zero. This means there is no increase in likelihood by rolling two even numbers in a row compared to rolling a number greater than 3. They are equally probable."
"To find out how many apples Jenna's mother and Jenna picked in total, we first need to determine how many apples Jenna picked. Since her mother got 20 apples and Jenna picked half as many, we calculate:

\[ \text{Apples picked by Jenna} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Mom's apples} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \]

Now, to find out the total number of apples they both picked, we add the apples Jenna picked to her mother's apples:

\[ \text{Total apples} = \text{Mom's apples} + \text{Jenna's apples} = 20 + 10 = 30 \]

Therefore, Jenna and her mother together picked a total of 30 apples from their apple farm."
"To find out how many rats are in each cage, let's first determine the total amount of straw distributed among the rodents and then calculate the number of rats based on this information.

Given:
- 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the small rodents.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- 20 pieces of straw are distributed among the rabbits.
- The rabbits' group is not mentioned in the question, but it's assumed to be part of the same calculation as the rodents since no other type of animal is specified or given any specific count.

First, we'll figure out how many rats there are by dividing the total straw given to the rodents by the amount of straw each rat gets:

\[ \text{Number of rats} = \frac{\text{Total Straw Given to Rodents}}{\text{Straw per Rat}} \]
\[ \text{Number of rats} = \frac{160}{6} \]

Now, let's calculate the number of rats:

\[ \text{Number of rats} = 26.666... \]

Since you can't have a fraction of a rat, we round down to the nearest whole number because you can't have half a rat:

\[ \text{Number of rats} = 26 \]

Next, we know there are 10 cages of hamsters that are kept alone, and each hamster is given 5 pieces of straw. To find out how many rats are in each cage, we need to divide the total number of hamster cages (which doesn't provide enough information about the distribution of rodents within these cages) by the number of rats in each cage.

However, without additional information, such as the total number of hamster cages or knowing how many rats are in each cage, we cannot accurately determine the number of rats in each cage. The provided data does not allow us to make an accurate deduction regarding the distribution of rodents within the hamster cages. 

If you could provide more details about the distribution of rodents within the hamster cages, I would be able to help you further."
"1) Mandy owes Benedict $100 initially.
2) The monthly interest rate is 2%, which translates to a yearly interest rate of 2/12 = 0.167 (rounded to four decimal places).
3) After 3 months, Mandy will have paid back 3*12*0.167 = $4.01 (rounded to four decimal places).
4) Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict an additional amount of $4.01.
The answer is 4.01."
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, let's break down the information given:

1. The cost to buy each bag was $20.
2. It costs $2 to transport each bag from the farm to the warehouse.
3. The trader made a total profit of $400 after selling all the bags at a rate of $30 each.

First, calculate the total cost of buying the bags:
\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Cost per bag} \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ \text{Total cost} = \$20 \times \text{Number of bags} \]

Next, subtract the transportation cost from the total cost to get the total revenue:
\[ \text{Revenue} = \text{Total cost} - \text{Transportation cost} \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = (\text{Total cost}) - (\text{Cost per bag} \times \text{Number of bags}) \]
\[ \text{Revenue} = (20 - 2 \times \text{Number of bags}) \times \text{Number of bags} \]

Finally, we know the trader made a total profit of $400. Profit is calculated as Revenue minus Cost:
\[ \text{Profit} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Cost} \]
\[ \$400 = (20 - 2 \times \text{Number of bags}) \times \text{Number of bags} - 20 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ \$400 = (20 - 2 \times \text{Number of bags}) \times \text{Number of bags} - 20 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ \$400 = (20 - 2 \times \text{Number of bags}) \times \text{Number of bags} - 20 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ \$400 = (20 - 2 \times \text{Number of bags}) \times \text{Number of bags} - 20 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ \$400 = 20 \times \text{Number of bags} - 20 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ \$400 = 0 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
This equation doesn't make sense because the number of bags cannot be zero if there are no other conditions or restrictions mentioned.

Since we've established that the total cost must equal the revenue minus the transportation cost (which includes the initial cost of buying the bags plus the transportation), we can set up the following equation based on the information provided:

\[ \text{Total cost} = \text{Revenue} - \text{Transportation cost} \]
\[ 20 \times \text{Number of bags} = 30 \times \text{Number of bags} - 2 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ 20 \times \text{Number of bags} = 28 \times \text{Number of bags} \]
\[ 20 = 28 \]
This equation also doesn't make sense, which indicates that our calculations are incorrect due to an error in interpreting the problem statement or the setup of equations.

Upon reevaluation, we realize that the correct approach should involve understanding the relationships between the numbers involved rather than trying to solve them algebraically directly. Let's rethink the scenario logically instead of mathematically:

If the trader started with 20 bags, and then bought another 23 (since he gave away 23 to Denny), and ended up with 12 bags after selling all of them at $30 each, we need to determine how many bags he actually sold.

Let \(x\) represent the number of bags sold. We start with 20 bags and add 23, making a total of \(20 + 23 = 43\) bags before selling any. After selling all 43 bags at $30 each, he ends up with 12 bags. This gives us the equation:

\[ x + 43 = 12 \]

Solving for \(x\):

\[ x = 12 - 43 \]
\[ x = -31 \]

However, this result contradicts the logic that the trader would have sold bags. The calculation suggests that the trader must have kept some bags, not sold all of them. Since the trader could not have kept all 20 bags and sold none, the logical interpretation is that the trader sold all 43 bags before giving any to Denny, meaning he gave away 23 bags and then sold the remaining 20.

Therefore, the trader sold 23 bags and gave away "
"1) The total cost of the tickets was 20.25.
2) The cost of the food was 20.25 - 4.50 = 15.75.
3) Since they went on 2 rides costing 33 each, the total cost of the rides was 2 * 33 = 66.
4) The total cost of the tickets and food is 20.25 + 15.75 = 36.
5) Since they split the cost evenly, each of them paid 36 / 3 = 12.

"To find out how much change Violetta will get, we first need to calculate the total cost of all the crayons she wants to buy. Since she needs 5 different colored crayons and one crayon costs $2, the total cost would be:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 5 \times \$2 = \$10 \]

Now, since Violetta has $20 and the total cost is $10, we subtract the total cost from her initial amount to find out how much change she will get:

\[ \text{Change} = \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

So, Violetta will get $10 in change."

The formula to find the number of children is:

\[ \text{Total population} - (\text{Number of men} + \text{Number of women}) \]

Substituting the given values into this formula gives us:

\[ 23,786 - (8,417 + 9,092) = 23,786 - 17,509 = 6,277 \]

So, there are 6,277 children in Soda."
"1) Elaine initially had 20 Pokemon cards. 
2) After collecting three times that number, she ended up with 20*3 = 60 Pokemon cards.
3) In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month, which means she collected 60-20 = 40 Pokemon cards.
4) The combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months is 60+40 = 100.
5) In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months, which means she collected 100*2 = 200 Pokemon cards.
6) Therefore, Elaine currently has 20 (initially) + 60 (after the first month) + 40 (after the second month) + 200 (after the third month) = 300 Pokemon cards.

"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate the amount he earns from each publisher based on the information given.

First, let's determine how much Mark earns from each publisher:

1. **Publisher A**: Since he earns 5 cents per sentence, and he edits 1000 sentences each week, he earns \(1000 \times \$0.05 = \$50\) per week.

2. **Publisher B**: We know that Publisher B pays him twice as much as Publisher A for each sentence. Therefore, for every sentence, he gets \(2 \times 5\% = 0.10\) times the amount paid by Publisher A. So, for 1000 sentences, he earns \(1000 \times \$0.10 = \$100\) per week from Publisher B.

Now, we add the amounts earned from both publishers to get the total weekly earnings:

Total weekly earnings = Earnings from Publisher A + Earnings from Publisher B

\[= \$50 + \$100\]

\[= \$150\]

Therefore, Mark makes $150 per week.
The answer is: $150$"

2) He ate a cheese and egg omelet for breakfast 3 days in the week using one more slice than he did per sandwich. Since he uses 2 slices per sandwich, he would use 2+1=3 slices per omelet. This means he used 3*3 = 9 slices of cheese for breakfast this week.
3) He also made a big dish of macaroni and cheese to last him several dinners for the week and used 8 slices of cheese in it. This means he used 8 slices of cheese for the macaroni and cheese.

"To find the cost of each cup, we first need to determine the total number of cups and then divide by the price per cup.

Given:

- The cost of 2 dozen (which equals 24 cups) cups is $1200 less than half a dozen plates' price.
- Half a dozen plates sell for $6000 each.

First, let's calculate the cost of half a dozen plates:

\[ \text{Cost of half a dozen plates} = \$6000 \times 6 = \$36000 \]

Since the cost of 2 dozen cups is $1200 less than this amount, we subtract $1200 from the total cost of half a dozen plates to get the cost of 2 dozen cups:

\[ \text{Cost of 2 dozen cups} = \$36000 - \$1200 = \$34800 \]

Now, we know the cost of 2 dozen cups ($34800) and we want to find out the cost of one cup. To do this, we divide the total cost by the number of cups:

\[ \text{Cost per cup} = \frac{\$34800}{24} = \$1400 \]

Therefore, the cost of each cup is $1400."
"To find out how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she will earn from babysitting and mowing lawns.

From babysitting, she earns:
4 times × $5 each = $20

From mowing lawns, she earns:
$4 each time × 4 times = $16

Adding both amounts together gives us the total earnings:
$20 (babysitting) + $16 (mowing lawns) = $36

Now, let's calculate how much more money she needs:
Cost of jacket + Cost of 2 pairs of shoes = $30 + ($20 x 2) = $30 + $40 = $70

Finally, we divide the remaining amount by the earnings per time she mows the lawn to find out how many times she needs to mow the lawn:
$70 ÷ $4 per lawn = 17.5

Since Sara cannot mow the lawn half a time, she needs to mow the lawn 18 times to afford the jacket and shoes."
"Let's say the number of red chickens Jerry has is \(R\), and the number of white chickens is \(W\). According to the problem, we know that:

1. The number of white chickens (\(W\)) is two more than the number of red chickens (\(R\)), which gives us \(W = R + 2\).
2. Each red chicken produces 3 eggs per day, while each white chicken produces 5 eggs per day. Together, they produce 42 eggs every day. This gives us the equation \(3R + 5(W - R) = 42\).

Substituting \(W\) from the first equation into the second equation gives us:

\[3R + 5(R + 2 - R) = 42\]

Simplifying this equation will help us find the value of \(R\).

First, simplify inside the parentheses:

\[3R + 5(R - R)\]
\[3R + 5(0)\] (since \(R\) cancels out)
\[3R\]

Now, substitute back into the original equation:

\[3R + 5(R - R) = 42\]
\[3R + 5(0) = 42\]
\[3R = 42\]

To solve for \(R\), divide both sides by 3:

\[R = \frac{42}{3}\]
\[R = 14\]

So, Jerry has 14 red chickens.
The answer is $\boxed{14}$."
"To find out how long it takes Gary to walk around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The perimeter (P) of a rectangle is given by the formula:

\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

Given that the length is 1.5 miles and the width is 6 miles, the perimeter would be:

\[ P = 2 \times (1.5 + 6) \]
\[ P = 2 \times 7.5 \]
\[ P = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now, if Gary walks at 3 miles per hour, to find out how many hours it takes him to cover 15 miles, we divide the distance by his speed:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} \]
\[ \text{Time} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, it takes Gary 5 hours to walk around the park."
"To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we first need to determine the pattern in the number of customers she counted each day.

Let's denote the number of customers on the first day as \(x\). According to the problem:

- On the second day, she counts 50 more customers than on the first day, which gives us \(x + 50\) customers.
- On the third day, the total number of customers is 500.

We know that the total number of customers over the three days (first, second, and third) is 500. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[x + (x + 50) + 500 = 500\]

Simplifying this equation:

\[2x + 550 = 500\]

Subtracting 550 from both sides gives:

\[2x = 50\]

Dividing both sides by 2:

\[x = 25\]

So, on the first day, Sloane counted 25 customers. To find out how many customers she counted on the third day (\(y\)), we add the additional 50 customers she counted on the second day:

\[y = x + 50 = 25 + 50 = 75\]

Therefore, Sloane counted 75 customers on the third day."
" Let's say the small pool initially has $x$ gallons of water. Then the big pool initially has $2x$ gallons of water.
After 4 minutes, the small pool will have $x-4$ gallons of water, and the big pool will have $2x-4$ gallons of water.
We know that the big pool now has four times as much water as the small pool, so we can set up the equation $2x-4=4(x-4)$.
Expanding the right side gives $2x-4=4x-16$.
Subtracting $2x$ from both sides gives $-4=-2x-16$.
Adding 16 to both sides gives $12=-2x$.
Dividing both sides by -2 gives $x=6$.
So the small pool initially had 6 gallons of water.
Now, since the big pool empties at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, and it has emptied 4 gallons in 4 minutes, the amount of water remaining in the big pool is $2x-4 = 2(6)-4 = 12-4 = 8$ gallons.
Therefore, the small pool now has 6 gallons of water.
The answer is: $6$."
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to earn enough to buy both the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total amount of money she needs for both items:

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00

Now let's add these amounts together to find out the total cost:

Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00 = $352.00

Next, we'll divide this total by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:

Hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage

Her hourly wage is $8.00 per hour. Let's substitute that into our equation:

Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00/hour

Finally, we perform the division to get the number of hours:

Hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00/hour = 43.00 hours

Therefore, Lori will need to work 43 hours to earn enough to buy both the shoes and the belt."
"1) The loan is for $2000 and Janeth will return an extra 10%, which amounts to $2000 * 10/100 = $200.
2) Therefore, the total amount that Janeth will return when she pays back the loan is $2000 + $200 = $2200.
3) Since she is paying $165 per month over 12 months, the total amount she is paying back is $165 * 12 = $1980.
4) Subtracting the total amount she paid back from the total amount she would have returned gives us the remaining balance. $2200 - $1980 = $220.

"1) In order to find out how many points Yuri scored, we need to find half of what Naomi scored and add 10. Half of 68 is 34. 34 plus 10 equals 44. Therefore, Yuri scored 44 points.
2) To find out how many points Brianna scored, we need to find out how many points Naomi scored plus 17. 68 plus 17 equals 85. Therefore, Brianna scored 85 points.
3) We know that Naomi scored 68 points and that Brianna scored 85 points. Together, Naomi and Brianna scored 68 + 85 = 153 points.
4) The total number of points scored by all four students is 251. Subtracting the points that Naomi and Brianna scored from the total gives us the points that Jojo scored. 251 minus 153 equals 98. Therefore, Jojo scored 98 points.
The answer is 98."
"To find out how much time Carmen spent playing these games, we first need to calculate the time it took her to solve each type of puzzle.

For the crossword puzzles:
- Each crossword puzzle takes 10 minutes to complete.

Given she solved 3 crossword puzzles, the total time spent on them would be \(3 \times 10 = 30\) minutes.

For the Sudoku puzzles:
- Each Sudoku puzzle takes 5 minutes to complete.

Given she solved 8 Sudoku puzzles, the total time spent on them would be \(8 \times 5 = 40\) minutes.

Adding both times together gives us the total time spent playing these games over the weekend:

\(30\, \text{minutes (crossword)} + 40\, \text{minutes (Sudoku)} = 70\, \text{minutes}\).

So, Carmen spent a total of 70 minutes playing these games.

"To calculate the total amount paid by Carlos and Benji for their respective rentals:

Carlos's rental costs:
- The canoe costs $30 per hour, and Carlos rented it for 3 hours, so \(30 \times 3 = \$90\).

Benji's rental costs:
- The banana boat raft costs $18 per hour, and Benji rented it for 5 hours, so \(18 \times 5 = \$90\).

Adding both amounts together gives us the total cost:
\(90 + 90 = \$180\).

Therefore, Carlos and Benji will pay a total of \$180 for their rentals.

**Note:** The calculation assumes that the canoe rental rate is consistent across all hours and the banana boat raft rental rate is also consistent throughout the duration of use."

"To calculate how much Chad still owes after using his gift card, let's break down the costs step by step:

1. Base Burrito: $6.50
2. Extra Meat: $2.00
3. Extra Cheese: $1.00
4. Avocado: $1.00
5. 2 Sausages/Sauces: $0.25 each (since he gets 2), so $0.25 x 2 = $0.50
6. Upgrade Meal: $3.00

Adding all these up gives us the total amount Chad spent on his meal before applying any discounts or coupons:

Total Cost = $6.50 + $2.00 + $1.00 + $1.00 + $0.50 + $3.00 = $13.00

Chad used a $5.00 gift card towards this cost, so we subtract that from the total cost to find out how much he still owes:

Amount Owing = Total Cost - Gift Card Amount = $13.00 - $5.00 = $8.00

So, Chad still owes $8.00 after using his gift card.

"1) At first, there were 120 watermelons on the farm.
2) 30% of these were ready for harvest, so there were 120 * 0.30 = 36 watermelons ready for harvest.
3) This leaves 120 - 36 = 84 watermelons remaining.
4) Two weeks later, 3/4 of the remaining watermelons were ready, which means 3/4 * 84 = 63 watermelons were ready for harvest.
5) This leaves 84 - 63 = 21 watermelons not ready to be harvested after the two weeks.

"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we first calculate the total number of slices needed by dividing the total number of friends by the number of slices per friend:

\[ \text{Total slices} = \frac{\text{Number of friends}}{\text{slices per friend}} = \frac{20}{4} = 5 \]

Since each pizza is cut into 8 portions, we divide the total number of slices by the number of slices per portion to find out how many pizzas are needed:

\[ \text{Pizzas needed} = \frac{\text{Total slices}}{\text{slices per portion}} = \frac{5}{8} \approx 0.625 \]

Given that you cannot order a fraction of a pizza, John will need to round up to the nearest whole number because he can't order part of a pizza. Therefore, John needs to order 1 pizza.

"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Number of Students**: The hall initially had 1000 students.

2. **Students Leaving Through Exit A**: It's given that 30% of the students went out through exit A. This means \(30\% \times 1000 = 300\) students left through exit A.

3. **Remaining Students**: After 300 students left through exit A, we're left with \(1000 - 300 = 700\) students.

4. **Students Leaving Through Exit B**: It's mentioned that 3/5 of the remaining students (after exiting through exit A) went out through exit B. So, \(3/5 \times 700 = 420\) students left through exit B.

5. **Number of Students Left Through Exit C**: To find out how many students left through exit C, subtract the sum of those who left through exits A and B from the initial total number of students. 

\[1000 - 300 - 420 = 280\]

"To find out how many fish there are in each aquarium, let's start by calculating the total number of snails in both aquariums.

Given:
- In the first aquarium, there are 4 snails.
- In the second aquarium, there are 32 snails.

Together, the total number of snails in both aquariums is \(4 + 32 = 36\) snails.

We're told that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the amount of fish in both aquariums. Let's denote the number of fish in each aquarium as \(F\).

So, we have:

\[|Snails_{First} - Snails_{Second}| = 2 \times F\]

Substituting the known values:

\[|36 - 32| = 2F\]
\[4 = 2F\]

Solving for \(F\):

\[F = \frac{4}{2}\]
\[F = 2\]

Therefore, there are 2 fish in each aquarium."
"To calculate the total amount Jean paid, we first need to determine the weekly earnings before any discounts:

1. Cost per hour for makeup application: $250
2. Hours per day: 6
3. Days per week: 4

Weekly earnings without discount = 6 hours/day * 4 days/week * $250/hour

Now let's calculate this:

Weekly earnings without discount = (6 * 4) * $250
= 24 * $250
= $6000

Jean gives a 10% discount on the total amount after the first week since she worked for a full week of 4 days. Let's find out the discount amount:

Discount amount = 10% of $6000
= 0.10 * $6000
= $600

So, the discounted price for the second week is:

Discounted price = Weekly earnings without discount - Discount amount
= $6000 - $600
= $5400

Since the process repeats every 4 weeks, we'll multiply the weekly discounted price by 4 to get the total amount paid over the 5-week period:

Total amount paid = $5400 * 4
= $21600

Therefore, Jean paid $21,600 in total for the movie production."
