"First, I need to calculate the total number of eggs Janet's ducks lay each day, which is 16.

Next, I'll determine how many eggs are consumed by Janet. She eats 3 eggs for breakfast each morning, so over a day, that's 3 eggs.

Then, she bakes 4 eggs for her friends daily, which are not eaten.

Subtracting the consumed and baked eggs from the total laid, I find that Janet has 9 eggs left each day.

These remaining eggs are sold at the farmers' market for $2 each. Multiplying the number of eggs by the selling price gives the daily revenue, which is $18.

"To determine Josh's profit from his house purchase, I'll start by calculating the total cost of the house after the initial purchase and the repairs.

Josh spent $80,000 on the house and an additional $50,000 in repairs, which adds up to $130,000.

Next, I'll account for the 150% increase in the house's value. To find the new value of the house, I'll calculate 150% of the total cost: 150% of $130,000 equals $195,000.

Finally, to find the profit, I'll subtract the original total cost from the new value: $195,000 minus $130,000 equals a profit of $65,000.

"First, I need to determine the total amount of feed Wendi uses daily. She provides each chicken three cups of feed, and she has 20 chickens.

So, the total daily feed requirement is 20 chickens multiplied by 3 cups per chicken, which equals 60 cups.

Next, I'll calculate the total feed given in the morning and afternoon. In the morning, she gives 15 cups, and in the afternoon, 25 cups. Together, that's 15 + 25 = 40 cups.

Finally, to find out how much feed is needed for the final meal, I'll subtract the feed already provided from the total daily requirement. So, 60 cups minus 40 cups equals 20 cups.

Therefore, Wendi needs to provide 20 cups of feed in the final meal.

"To determine the total time Carla spends downloading the file, I'll break down the process into manageable parts.

First, I'll calculate the total time it takes to download the entire 200 GB file at the standard speed of 2 GB per minute. Dividing 200 GB by 2 GB per minute gives 100 minutes.

However, during 40% of the download, Windows requires a restart, which takes 20 minutes. This interrupt stops the download progress and forces a restart.

Since the restart restarts the download from the beginning, the time lost during the restart is equivalent to the time it would have taken to download that 40% of the file. Calculating 40% of 100 minutes gives 40 minutes.

Therefore, the total time spent downloading is the sum of the time taken to download the first 40% (40 minutes), the 20-minute restart, and the remaining 60% of the download (60 minutes). Adding these together results in a total of 120 minutes.

"First, I need to determine the total cost and revenue over multiple years for Carlos's lemon tree.

The initial planting cost is a one-time expense of $90. Each year, the tree produces 7 lemons, which he can sell for $1.50 each, generating a revenue of $10.50 per year. However, the costs include $3 per year for watering and feeding the tree.

To find out when Carlos starts earning money, I'll calculate the net profit each year by subtracting the costs from the revenue. The net profit per year is $10.50 minus $3, which equals $7.50.

Next, I'll consider the initial planting cost. After the first year, the tree has produced 7 lemons, generating $10.50 in revenue. Subtracting the $3 cost, Carlos has a net profit of $7.50. This means he starts earning money in the first year.

But then I spill one liter of the orange drink. I need to find out how much water is left in the remaining 24 liters. Hmm, let's break this down step by step.

First, let me figure out how much water is in the original orange drink. It's two-thirds water, so if I have 10 liters, then the amount of water in it should be (2/3) * 10 liters. Let me calculate that: 2/3 of 10 is 20/3, which is approximately 6.666... liters. So, about 6.67 liters of water in the orange drink.

Now, the orange drink is being poured into 15 liters of pineapple drink. But before that, I spill one liter of the orange drink. So, I need to figure out how much orange drink is left after spilling one liter. Since I started with 10 liters and spilled one, that leaves me with 9 liters of orange drink.

"First, I recognize that Kyle paid $19.50 for the book after a 25% discount was applied to the original price.

To find the original price, I need to determine what the original price was before the discount was taken.

Since the discount is 25%, the amount paid represents 75% of the original price.

I can set up the equation: 0.75 * Original Price = $19.50

To solve for the original price, I divide both sides by 0.75.

Original Price = $19.50 / 0.75
Original Price = $26

Therefore, the original price of the book was $26.

"First, I'll calculate the total cost of the items Marie ordered.

The chicken meal costs $12.

Marie bought 5 packs of milk at $3 each, so that's 5 multiplied by $3, which equals $15.

She also bought 4 apples at $1.50 each, so that's 4 multiplied by $1.50, totaling $6.

Adding up these amounts, the total cost before pizza is $12 + $15 + $6 = $33.

Marie paid a total of $50, so the cost of the pizza must be $50 minus $33, which is $17.

Each box of pizza costs $8.50, so dividing the total pizza cost by the price per box gives the number of boxes: $17 divided by $8.50 equals 2.

"Alright, so I've got this problem here about Gloria shopping for boots. Let me try to figure it out step by step. Hmm, okay, so she's got a pair of boots that fit her budget, but she has to choose between those boots and two pairs of high heels. The problem says that together, the two pairs of high heels cost five dollars less than the boots. One pair of heels costs $33, and the other pair costs twice as much. The question is, how many dollars are the boots?

Let me break this down. First, let's denote the cost of the boots as a variable. Let's say the boots cost B dollars. That seems logical. Now, there are two pairs of high heels. One costs $33, and the other costs twice as much as the first one. So, if one pair is $33, the other pair must be 2 times 33, which is $66. Let me write that down.

So, the two pairs of high heels cost $33 and $66. That means together, they cost 33 + 66. Let me calculate that: 33 plus 66 is 99. Okay, so together, the"
"First, I'll denote Darrell's current age as 7x and Allen's current age as 11x, based on the given ratio of 7:11.

Since their combined ages are 162, I can set up the equation:
7x + 11x = 162

Combining like terms gives:
18x = 162

Solving for x:
x = 162 ÷ 18
x = 9

Now, to find Allen's current age:
11x = 11 * 9 = 99

Finally, to find Allen's age 10 years from now:
99 + 10 = 109
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- The ratio of Darrell's age to Allen's age is \(7:11\).
- The sum of their current ages is \(162\) years.

**Let’s denote:**
- Darrell's age = \(7x\)
- Allen's age = \(11x\)

"First, I need to determine each friend's guess based on the information provided.

The first friend guessed 80 jelly beans.

The second friend said 20 more than half of the first guess. Half of 80 is 40, so the second friend's guess is 60.

The third friend mentioned a guess that is 25% more than the first guess. 25% of 80 is 20, so the third friend's guess is 100.

Next, I'll calculate the average of these three guesses by adding them together and dividing by the number of guesses.

Adding the three guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240

Finally, dividing the total by 3 to find the average: 240 ÷ 3 = 80

"First, I note that John has 10 dogs and each dog requires 0.5 hours per day to be taken care of.

To find the total daily hours spent with all dogs, I multiply the number of dogs by the time each dog needs: 10 dogs × 0.5 hours/dog = 5 hours per day.

Since there are 7 days in a week, I multiply the daily hours by 7 to get the weekly hours: 5 hours/day × 7 days/week = 35 hours per week.

Therefore, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs.
</think>

To determine how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the daily hours spent with the dogs:**
   - Number of dogs: 10
   - Time per dog per day: 0.5 hours

"Alright, so I've got this problem here: Gretchen has 110 coins, and there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. I need to figure out how many gold coins she has. Hmm, okay, let's break this down step by step.

First, I should probably define some variables to represent the number of gold and silver coins. Let me call the number of silver coins ""S"" and the number of gold coins ""G"". That makes sense because we're dealing with two types of coins, and using variables will help me set up an equation.

The problem says she has a total of 110 coins. So, the sum of gold and silver coins should be 110. That gives me my first equation: G + S = 110. That seems straightforward.

Next, it mentions that there are 30 more gold coins than silver coins. Hmm, okay. So, if I subtract the number of silver coins from the number of gold coins, I should get 30. So, that translates to G = S + 30. Got that.

Now, I have two equations:

2. G = S + 3"
"Okay, so I need to figure out how many jewels Siobhan has. Hmm, let's see. The problem says:

Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.

Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels.

Raymond has 40 jewels.

Alright, let's break this down step by step. Maybe I should start by writing down what each person has in terms of the others.

First, it's helpful to assign variables to each person's number of jewels. Let's let R represent Raymond's jewels, A represent Aaron's jewels, and S represent Siobhan's jewels. That seems straightforward.

We know from the problem that Raymond has 40 jewels. So, R = 40.

Next, the problem says Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. So, Aaron's number of jewels is half of Raymond's plus 5. Translating that into an equation: A = (1/2) * R + 5.

Since we know R is 40, let's plug that into the equation for Aaron. So, A = (1/2)*40 + 5.

Calculating that, half of 40 is 20, and "

"Okay, so Terry eats 2 yogurts every day. They're on sale, and now you can buy 4 for $5.00. I need to figure out how much he spends over 30 days. Hmm, let me break this down step by step.

First, let me see how many days Terry is eating yogurt. It says 30 days. So, that's straightforward. Terry eats 2 each day, so over 30 days, he'll eat 2 multiplied by 30. Let me write that out: 2 * 30 = 60. So, he eats 60 yogurts in total over 30 days.

But wait, the sale is 4 for $5.00. So, instead of buying 60 individually, it might be cheaper to buy in bulk. I need to figure out how many sets of 4 he can buy over 30 days and then calculate the total cost.

"First, I need to determine how much money John made from selling his lego sets. He sold 13 lego sets at $15 each, so I'll calculate the total earnings by multiplying the number of sets by the price per set.

Next, I'll calculate how much he spent on video games. He bought 8 games at $20 each, so I'll multiply the number of games by the cost per game.

Subtracting the total cost of the video games from his total earnings will give me the amount of money he has left after the purchase.

Finally, since John started with 13 lego sets and ended up with $5 left, I'll subtract the remaining money from the initial amount to find out how many lego sets he still has.

"First, determine John's total weekly running time. He runs 60 miles a week and spends 3 hours on the first day, with the remaining two days running half that time each.

So, the first day is 3 hours. The next two days are each 1.5 hours, totaling 3 hours. This means John runs a total of 6 hours a week.

Next, to find his average running speed, divide the total distance by the total time. John runs 60 miles in 6 hours, which gives an average speed of 10 miles per hour.

"Alright, let's try to solve this problem step by step. Hmm, so Dana has different speeds for running, walking, and skipping. The problem says she can run four times faster than she can walk, and she can skip at half the speed she can run. They also tell us that she can skip at 3 miles per hour. 

First, let me parse that information. If skipping is half the speed of running, and skipping is 3 mph, then running must be twice that, right? So running speed is 6 mph. That makes sense because 3 is half of 6. 

Now, running is four times faster than walking. So if running is 6 mph, walking must be a quarter of that. Let me calculate that: 6 divided by 4 is 1.5. So her walking speed is 1.5 mph. Okay, got that.

So, to recap: running speed is 6 mph, walking speed is 1.5 mph, and skipping speed is 3 mph. 

The question is asking how many miles she can travel in six hours if she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds walking. Hmm, so in six hours, she spends 2 hours running and 4"

"Alright, so I have this problem here about Polly and the dragon Perg. Let me try to break it down step by step. 

First, the dragon is at a certain height, and it can breathe fire within 1000 feet. Polly can throw a javelin normally, which is 400 feet. But when she holds a gemstone, she can throw it three times farther. So, when she holds the gem, her throw distance increases.

The question is asking how far outside of the dragon's reach Polly can stand and still hit the dragon with the javelin. That means I need to find the extra distance beyond 1000 feet that Polly can go while still being able to hit the dragon.

Let me see. Normally, without the gem, she can throw it 400 feet. When she holds the gem, she can throw it 3 times farther. So, 3 times 400 feet is... let me calculate that. 3 * 400 is 1200 feet. So, when she holds the gem, she can throw it 1200 feet.

"Okay, so Grandma Jones baked 5 apple pies for the fireman's luncheon. She cut each pie into 8 pieces. That means each pie is divided into 8 equal parts, right? So, if there are 5 pies, how many total pieces are there? Hmm, let's see. 5 pies multiplied by 8 pieces each. That would be 5 times 8. Let me calculate that... 5 times 8 is 40. So, there are 40 pieces of pie in total.

Now, at the end of the evening, there were 14 pieces remaining. That means that some pieces were taken by the guests. To find out how many pieces were taken, I need to subtract the remaining pieces from the total number of pieces. So, total pieces are 40, remaining pieces are 14. So, 40 minus 14. Let me do that subtraction. 40 minus 10 is 30, and then minus 4 more is 26. So, 40 minus 14 equals 26.

Therefore, 26 pieces of pie were taken by the guests. That makes sense because if you started with 40 and"
"First, I need to determine how many calories are in a 300g bag of chips. Since a serving is 250 calories, a 300g bag contains 250 calories multiplied by 1.2, which equals 300 calories.

Next, I'll calculate the total calories consumed so far. The individual has already consumed 1800 calories.

To find out how many more calories can be consumed without exceeding the daily target of 2000, I'll subtract the calories already consumed from the daily target: 2000 minus 1800 equals 200 calories remaining.

Finally, I'll determine how many grams of chips can be eaten with the remaining 200 calories. Since 300g provides 300 calories, I'll divide the remaining calories by the calories per gram: 200 divided by 300 equals approximately 0.6667 grams.

"First, I need to determine how many pounds of beeswax Charlie can produce with $10.00 in supplies. Since one pound of beeswax costs $10.00, he can make one pound of beeswax with the available money.

Next, I calculate how many tapered candles he can make with one pound of beeswax. For every pound of beeswax, he can create 10 tapered candles. Therefore, with one pound, he can produce 10 candles.

Since he's making 10 candles, he will also need 10 wicks. The total number of candles he sells will be 10.

Each candle sells for $2.00, so the total revenue from selling 10 candles is $20.00.

The cost of the beeswax and wicks is $10.00, which is the initial cost for producing the candles.

I need to find out how many boxes can be added before the total weight exceeds 5000 pounds.

Let me write down the key pieces of information:

- Bridge capacity: 5000 pounds
- Weight of driver + empty truck: 3755 pounds
- Each box weight: 15 pounds

So, the total weight the truck can carry on top of the driver and empty truck is 5000 - 3755. Let me calculate that:

"To determine the total number of raspberries in the bush, I'll start by considering the clusters. Each cluster contains 20 fruit, and there are 6 clusters. So, multiplying 20 by 6 gives me 120.

Next, I'll account for the individual scattered fruits. There are 67 individual fruits that don't belong to the clusters.

Finally, I'll add the number of fruits in the clusters to the number of scattered fruits to find the total number of raspberries. This means 120 plus 67 equals 187 raspberries in total.

To determine the total number of raspberries in the bush, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of raspberries in the clusters:**
   - Each cluster contains **20 fruit**.
   - There are **6 clusters**.
   - **Total raspberries in clusters** = \( 20 \text{ fruit/cluster} \times 6 \text{ clusters} = 120 \text{ raspberries} \).

"First, I need to determine the number of good oranges in the basket. The basket contains a total of 25 oranges.

It's given that 20% of the oranges are unripe. To find the number of unripe oranges, I'll calculate 20% of 25. 

20% of 25 is 5. So, there are 5 unripe oranges.

Next, the problem states that there are 2 sour oranges. These are separate from the unripe ones, so I'll add these to the count of unripe oranges.

5 unripe oranges + 2 sour oranges = 7 oranges that are either unripe or sour.

The problem also mentions that there is 1 bad orange. This is another separate category, so I'll add this to the previous total.

7 unripe or sour oranges + 1 bad orange = 8 oranges that are either unripe, sour, or bad.

Now, to find the number of good oranges, I'll subtract the total number of non-good oranges from the total number of oranges in the basket.

25 total oranges - 8 non-good oranges = 17 good oranges.

Therefore, there are 17 good oranges in the basket.

"Okay, so Janet is buying a brooch for her daughter, and I need to figure out how much she paid in total. Let me break this down step by step because I want to make sure I understand each part correctly.

First, she buys the material for the brooch for $500. That seems straightforward. So, the initial cost is $500. Then, she has to pay another $800 to have it constructed. So, now I can add those two amounts together to get the total cost before any additional fees or charges.

Let me write that out:

Cost of material: $500

Cost to construct: $800

So, total so far: $500 + $800 = $1300

Now, after that, she pays 10% of that total to get it inscribed. Hmm, inscribed in a brooch... I think that means she's insuring the brooch against theft or damage. So, she has to pay a percentage of the total cost as a premium for the insurance. The question says she pays 10% of the total amount to get it insured.

"Okay, let me try to figure out this problem step by step. So, Marcy is working for a company for 40 years and gets an annual pension of $50,000 each year. Now, starting after 20 years, she becomes entitled to 5% of the value of the pension per year. If she quits after 30 years, what will her annual pension be?

Hmm, so first, let me break down the information. She works for 40 years, so she gets a pension of $50,000 each year for those 40 years. Then, starting after 20 years, which would be in the 21st year, she gets 5% of the pension. So, after year 20, her pension increases to 5% of $50,000 each year.

Wait, hold on, so before year 20, she still gets a regular $50,000 each year, but starting from year 21, her pension increases. So, does that mean that from year 21 to year 40, she gets 5% of $50,000 each year? Let me"
"First, I need to determine the total number of months in a year, which is 12 months.

The streaming service has two payment periods: the first half of the year and the second half. Each half consists of 6 months.

Aleena pays $140 per month for the first 6 months. To find the total for this period, I multiply $140 by 6.

For the second half of the year, the streaming company charges 10% less than $140. I'll calculate 10% of $140 and subtract it from $140 to get the reduced rate.

Finally, I'll multiply the reduced rate by 6 to find the total payment for the second half of the year. Adding the totals from both halves will give the overall amount Aleena has paid by the end of the year.

"Okay, so I've got this problem here about a treasure chest with different types of gems: diamonds, rubies, and emeralds. Let me try to figure out how many gems there are in total. 

First, the problem says there are 175 diamonds. That's straightforward. So, diamonds = 175. 

Next, it mentions that there are 35 fewer rubies than diamonds. Hmm, okay, so if diamonds are 175, then rubies must be 175 minus 35. Let me write that down: rubies = diamonds - 35. So, rubies = 175 - 35. Let me calculate that. 175 minus 35 is... 140. So, rubies are 140. 

Now, the problem also says that there are twice the number of emeralds than the rubies. So, emeralds are double the number of rubies. If rubies are 140, then emeralds = 2 * rubies. So, emeralds = 2 * 140. Let me compute that. 2 times 140 is "

"First, let's define the variables. Let L represent the number of games lost by the team. Since they won 8 more games than they lost, the number of games won can be expressed as L + 8.

Next, we know that the total number of games played is 22. Therefore, the sum of the games won and lost should equal 22. This gives us the equation:

L + (L + 8) = 22

Combining like terms, we get:

2L + 8 = 22

Subtracting 8 from both sides:

2L = 14

Finally, dividing both sides by 2:

"Okay, let's see. Greg has an alarm that rings three times a day. Today, the first time it rang four times. The second time, it rang three times as long as the first time. The third time, it rang half as long as the second time. I need to figure out how many times the alarm rang in total today.

Hmm, so the alarm rings three times each time it goes off. That means each ring is a separate event, right? So if it rings three times, that's three separate signals. But the problem is about the total number of rings, not the duration.

Wait, let me make sure. It says the alarm rings three times a day as a reminder. So, regardless of how long it rings each time, it's three rings in total each day. But then it mentions the first time it went off four times. Wait, that seems contradictory.

Hold on, maybe I misread. It says, ""Greg has an alarm set to ring three times a day as a reminder."" So, each day, the alarm is set to ring three times. But then it says, ""The first time it went off today, it rang four times."" That seems confusing because if the alarm is set to ring three times"
"First, I need to determine Sylvie's initial salary. The company pays each employee $600 per month.

Next, I'll calculate the annual salary by multiplying the monthly salary by 12: 600 × 12 = $7,200 per year.

Since Sylvie has been with the company for five years, her salary will be increased by 10% each year for the next three years.

I'll calculate the first year's increase: 7,200 × 0.10 = $720. Adding this to the original salary: 7,200 + 720 = $7,920.

For the second year, the salary is increased by 10% of $7,920: 7,920 × 0.10 = $792. Adding this gives: 7,920 + 792 = $8,712.

In the third year, the salary is increased by 10% of $8,712: 8,712 × 0.10 = $871.20. Adding this results in: 8"
"First, I'll define the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \).

According to the problem, Marilyn sold 10 times as many copies as Harald, so Marilyn sold \( 10H \) copies.

The total number of copies sold by both is 88,000. Therefore, I can set up the equation:
\[ H + 10H = 88,000 \]

Combining like terms gives:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find the value of \( H \), I'll divide both sides of the equation by 11:
\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of his record.

"First, I need to determine how many guests will actually attend the party. Christina invited 16 friends, and 1/4 of them don't show up. Calculating 1/4 of 16 gives me 4 guests who won't attend.

Subtracting those 4 guests from the invited total of 16, I find that 12 guests will attend the party.

Next, since Christina needs 0.75 gift bags per guest, I multiply the number of attendees by 0.75. This results in 12 multiplied by 0.75, which equals 9 gift bags required.

Finally, each gift bag costs $2, so I multiply the number of gift bags needed by the cost per bag. 9 multiplied by $2 equals $18. Therefore, Christina will spend $18 on gift bags.
</think>

To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, let's break down the problem step by step.

**1. Calculate the number of attendees:**

- **Invited guests:** 16
- **Guests who don't show up:** \( \frac{1}{4} \times 16 = 4 \)

"Alright, so Ted the T-Rex is planning to bring potato salad to a dinosaur picnic, and he wants to make sure there's enough for everyone. Let me try to figure out how much potato salad he needs to bring.

First, the problem says that an adult dinosaur will eat 10 lbs of potato salad. Okay, so each adult eats 10 pounds. Then, it mentions that a child will eat half as much as an adult. Hmm, so if an adult eats 10 lbs, a child would eat half of that, which is... let me calculate that. Half of 10 is 5, so each child eats 5 lbs of potato salad. Got that down.

Now, Ted is planning for 20 adults and 5 children at the picnic. I need to find out the total amount of potato salad required. So, I guess I should calculate how much all the adults will eat together and then add that to the total amount the children will eat. That makes sense.

Starting with the adults: there are 20 of them, and each one eats 10 lbs. So, to find the total for adults, I can multiply the number of adults by the amount each adult eats. That would be "
"First, I need to determine how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy and Cindy has four pets, Marcia has 4 + 2 = 6 pets.

Next, I calculate the number of pets Jan has. Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, so Jan has 3 * 6 = 18 pets.

Finally, to find the total number of pets all three have, I add up the pets each person has: 18 (Jan) + 6 (Marcia) + 4 (Cindy) = 28 pets in total.

"Okay, so I need to solve this problem about Lee and Gerald's times in the 400-meter hurdles. Let me try to break it down step by step.

First, the problem says that Lee used to be able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald would run it. So, if I let Gerald's original time be something, say G seconds, then Lee's time would be G minus 2 seconds. But I don't know what G is yet.

Then, it says that Gerald changed his diet, which improved his speed by 10%. So, Gerald's speed went up by 10%, which means his time should decrease, right? But I need to relate this to Lee's time.

Wait, the problem also says that Lee runs the hurdles in 38 seconds. So, Lee's time is 38 seconds. Since Lee was two seconds faster than Gerald, that means Gerald's original time must be Lee's time plus 2 seconds. So, Gerald's original time G is 38 + 2 = 40 seconds. Got it, so Gerald's original time was 40 seconds.

Now, Gerald's speed improved by 10%. So, if his original"
"First, I identify the number of dogs, which is given as 60.

Next, since the number of cats is two for every dog, I calculate the number of cats by multiplying the number of dogs by 2: 2 × 60 = 120 cats.

Then, I determine the combined number of cats and dogs: 120 cats + 60 dogs = 180 pets.

Finally, the number of rabbits is twelve less than this combined total, so I subtract 12 from 180 to find the number of rabbits: 180 - 12 = 168 rabbits.

Adding the number of cats, dogs, and rabbits together gives the total number of pets in the neighborhood: 120 + 60 + 168 = 348 pets.
</think>

Let's solve the problem step by step.

**Given:**
- Number of dogs = 60
- Number of cats = 2 × Number of dogs
- Number of rabbits = (Number of cats + Number of dogs) - 12

"First, I need to determine the number of girls in the grade 5 class. Since there are 200 grade 5 students in total and 2/5 are boys, I'll calculate the number of boys by multiplying 200 by 2/5. 

200 multiplied by 2/5 equals 80. So, there are 80 boys in the class.

Next, I'll find out how many girls there are by subtracting the number of boys from the total number of students. 

200 minus 80 equals 120 girls.

Now, I know that 2/3 of the girls are in the girl scout. I'll calculate the number of girls in the girl scout by multiplying the total number of girls by 2/3.

120 multiplied by 2/3 equals 80 girls in the girl scout.

Finally, to find out how many girls are not in the girl scout, I'll subtract the number of girls in the girl scout from the total number of girls.

120 minus 80 equals 40 girls who are not in the girl scout.

"Okay, so Freda is making tomato sauce from canned tomatoes. The problem says that when she cooks the tomatoes into sauce, they lose half their volume. Hmm, so if she starts with a certain amount of volume, the sauce ends up with half that volume. 

Let me break down the problem step by step. First, she uses 16-ounce cans of tomatoes. Each can contains three tomatoes. So, for every can, she gets three tomatoes. Now, when she cooks those tomatoes into sauce, the volume is halved. That means if she starts with, say, 16 ounces of tomatoes, after cooking, she'll have 8 ounces of sauce. 

Freda’s last batch made 32 ounces of sauce. I need to figure out how many tomatoes she used. 

Let me think about the relationships here. Each can gives her three tomatoes, and each can makes half its volume in sauce. So, if I can find out how many cans she used to make 32 ounces of sauce, I can then find the number of tomatoes.

"First, I'll calculate the total cost of all the lumber Sasha purchased.

She bought ten 2 x 4 x 10 boards at $10 each, which amounts to 10 multiplied by $10, totaling $100.

She also bought five 4 x 4 x 10 boards at $16 each, which is 5 multiplied by $16, equaling $80.

Adding these together, the total cost is $100 plus $80, which equals $180.

Next, I'll determine the total revenue from selling all the boards. Each 2 x 4 x 10 board is sold at a 50% markup, so they're sold for $15 each. Selling ten of them brings in 10 times $15, totaling $150.

The five 4 x 4 x 10 boards are sold at their original price of $16 each, which amounts to 5 multiplied by $16, resulting in $80.

Adding the revenue from both sets of boards, the total revenue is $150 plus $80, totaling $230.

"First, I recognize that the ratio of sugar to water is 7:13, which means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water.

Let’s denote the number of parts of sugar as 7x and the number of parts of water as 13x.

According to the problem, the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoonfuls. Therefore, I can set up the equation:

7x + 13x = 120

Combining like terms gives:

20x = 120

To find the value of x, I divide both sides of the equation by 20:

x = 120 / 20 = 6

Now, to find the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar, I multiply the number of parts of sugar (7x) by x:

7 * 6 = 42

So, Katy used 42 teaspoonfuls of sugar.

"First, I'll calculate the total number of vehicles that were originally at the port. There were 2 containers, each containing 5 vehicles, so that's 2 times 5, which equals 10 vehicles.

On the second day, the customs officer counted additional containers. Let's denote the number of containers imported on the second day as \( x \). Each container also holds 5 vehicles, so the number of vehicles brought in the second day is \( 5x \).

The total number of vehicles at the port after the second day is given as 30. Therefore, the sum of the original vehicles and the imported vehicles on the second day should equal 30. This can be expressed as:

\( 10 + 5x = 30 \)

To find \( x \), I'll subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\( 5x = 20 \)

Then, I'll divide both sides by 5:

"First, I need to determine Lylah's salary four years ago. Since Adrien's salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, I can express Adrien's salary as 1.3 times Lylah's salary. Given that Adrien earned $40,000 four years ago, I can set up the equation 1.3L = 40,000, where L represents Lylah's salary.

Solving for L, I divide both sides by 1.3, which gives me L = 40,000 / 1.3 ≈ 30,769.23. So, Lylah's salary four years ago was approximately $30,769.23.

Next, I need to calculate the salary increases for both Adrien and Lylah over the four years. Adrien's salary increased by 30%, so his new salary is 1.3 times the original, which is 1.3 * 40,000 = $52,000.

"First, I need to determine the total number of clients Kim will have. He already has 3 clients and is considering 5 more, so the total number of clients will be 3 + 5 = 8 clients.

Next, I'll calculate the total amount of bleach needed. Each client requires 2 bottles of bleach, so for 8 clients, that's 2 bottles multiplied by 8 clients, totaling 16 bottles of bleach.

Then, I'll calculate the total cost for the bleach. Each bottle costs $2, so 16 bottles will cost 16 multiplied by $2, which equals $32.

Moving on to the packs of cloths, each client needs a pack costing $5. With 8 clients, the total cost for cloths will be 8 multiplied by $5, resulting in $40.

Now, I'll find the total expenses by adding the cost of bleach and cloths. That gives $32 + $40 = $72.

Kim's weekly income is $92. To find the profit, I'll subtract the total expenses from the weekly income: $92 - $72 = $20.

Therefore, Kim's weekly profit will be $20.

"Okay, so Debra is monitoring a beehive and wants to figure out how many bees return to the hive in the last 6 hours of the day. Hmm, let me try to break this down step by step.

First, she observes 30 bees leaving the hive in the first 6 hours. That seems straightforward. So, in the first 6 hours, 30 bees are departing. Let me note that down.

Now, moving on. She sees half as many bees return in the next 6 hours. So, if 30 bees left, half of that would be 15 bees returning. So, in the second 6 hours, 15 bees are coming back. That seems clear too.

Then, it says she sees two times as many bees as she saw first leave the hive fly from the hive and leave in the next 6 hours. Hmm, okay, so she saw 30 bees leave in the first 6 hours. So, two times that would be 60 bees. So, in the next 6 hours, 60 bees are coming back. Wait, that's a lot more than the previous 15.

"Okay, so I have this problem here where Brittany and her mom go to the museum. The admission costs are $12 for adults and $10 for children. Brittany's mom gives the cashier money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. She gets $8 in change back. I need to figure out how much money she gave the cashier in total.

Hmm, let me break this down. First, the cost of the tickets. There's an adult ticket at $12 and a child ticket at $10. So, if she buys both, the total cost should be the sum of these two amounts, right?

Let me write that out: Adult ticket is $12, child ticket is $10. So, total cost = $12 + $10. Let me calculate that. 12 plus 10 is 22. So, the total cost for both tickets is $22.

Now, the problem says that Brittany's mom gave her money for 1 child ticket and 1 adult ticket. So that's the total amount she gave, which is $22. But she received $8 in change. Hmm, so does that mean she gave the cashier $22, and since she"
"Okay, so I have this problem here: Charlie has three times as many Facebook friends as Dorothy. James has four times as many friends on Facebook as Dorothy. If Charlie has 12 friends on Facebook, how many friends does James have? Hmm, let me try to figure this out step by step.

First, let me parse the information given. The problem mentions three people: Charlie, Dorothy, and James. It says that Charlie has three times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if I let the number of friends Dorothy has be some number, then Charlie's number would be three times that. Similarly, James has four times as many friends as Dorothy. So, if I know Dorothy's number, I can find James's number.

But wait, the problem gives me a specific number for Charlie: 12 friends. So, since Charlie has three times as many as Dorothy, I can use that information to find out how many friends Dorothy has. Once I have Dorothy's number, I can easily find out how many friends James has by multiplying that number by four.

Let me write down what I know:

- Let D be the number of friends Dorothy has.
- Charlie has 3 * D friends.
- James has 4 * D friends.

"Okay, so Steve and Tim are racing to get home from school. Steve lives further away, but he can bike faster. I need to figure out who will win and how long the waiting time will be. Let me break it down step by step.

First, let's figure out how long it takes each of them to bike to school. The distance Steve has to cover is 3 miles, and he bikes at 440 feet per minute. Tim lives 2 miles away, and he skates at 264 feet per minute.

Wait, the units here are in miles and feet, so I should probably convert everything to the same unit to make the calculations easier. Let me convert miles to feet because the speeds are given in feet per minute. I know that 1 mile is 5280 feet. So, Steve's distance is 3 miles, which is 3 * 5280 feet. Let me calculate that: 3 * 5280 = 15840 feet. Tim's distance is 2 miles, so that's 2 * 5280 = 10560 feet.

"First, I need to determine the total revenue Shawnda made each type of vehicle.

For bicycles, each has two tires, and each tire costs 25 cents. So, for 5 bicycles, the cost is 5 multiplied by 2 tires, which equals 10 tires. At 25 cents per tire, that's 10 times 0.25 dollars, totaling $2.50.

Next, for tricycles, each has three tires. With 3 tricycles, that's 3 multiplied by 3 tires, equaling 9 tires. At 25 cents per tire, the revenue is 9 times 0.25 dollars, which amounts to $2.25.

Lastly, for the unicycle, which has one tire, one tire costs 25 cents.

Adding all the revenues together: $2.50 (bicycles) + $2.25 (tricycles) + $0.25 (unicycle) equals $5.00.

"To determine the total age of the four birds, I start by identifying the relationships between their ages. 

First, it's given that Sally Four is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, Sally Four must also be 8 years old.

Next, Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four. Calculating this, Granny Red is 2 multiplied by 8, which equals 16 years old.

Lastly, Sally Two is three years older than Granny Red. Adding 3 years to Granny Red's age, Sally Two is 16 plus 3, resulting in 19 years old.

Finally, to find the total age of all four birds, I add their individual ages together: 8 (Sally Four) + 16 (Granny Red) + 19 (Sally Two) + 8 (Sally Thirtytwo) equals 41 years.

"First, I need to determine the minimum payment Jessica is required to make for each of her debts. She wants to pay 50% more than the minimum.

For her student loans, the minimum payment is $300, so 50% of that is $150. Adding that to the minimum, the total payment for student loans would be $450 per month.

For her credit card, the minimum payment is $200, so 50% of that is $100. Adding that to the minimum, the total payment for the credit card would be $300 per month.

For her mortgage, the minimum payment is $500, so 50% of that is $250. Adding that to the minimum, the total payment for the mortgage would be $750 per month.

Next, I'll calculate the total monthly payment by adding the payments for all three debts: $450 (student loans) + $300 (credit card) + $750 (mortgage) = $1,500 per month.

Finally, to find out how much Jessica pays in a year, I'll multiply the total monthly payment by 12 months"
"Billy needs to peel and cut 60 potatoes. Each potato takes 1.5 minutes to peel and 5 seconds to cut.

First, I'll calculate the total time for peeling all 60 potatoes. 60 potatoes multiplied by 1.5 minutes per potato equals 90 minutes.

Next, I'll calculate the total time for cutting all 60 potatoes. 60 potatoes multiplied by 5 seconds per potato equals 300 seconds, which is 5 minutes.

"Okay, so Juan and his brother Carlos are selling lemonade. I need to figure out how much they spent on lemons if their total profit is $25. Let me break this down step by step.

First, let's figure out the costs. For each gallon, they spend $3 on lemons and $2 on sugar. So, the total cost per gallon is $3 plus $2, which is $5. That makes sense.

Next, they make 20 glasses of lemonade per gallon. So, for each gallon, they make 20 glasses. That means each glass is sold for $0.50. Let me check that. If each glass is $0.50, then 20 glasses would be 20 times $0.50, which is $10 per gallon. Hmm, okay, so they make $10 in revenue for each gallon.

Wait, but they also have costs. So, for each gallon, they spend $5 on ingredients. So, the cost per gallon is $5, and their revenue is $10. So, their profit per gallon should be revenue minus cost, right? So that would be $10 minus $5, which is $5"

"Alright, so I have this problem here: Two candidates are running for class representative at Sarai's school. The winner got 3/4 of the votes, and the total number of students who voted was 80. I need to find out how many votes the loser got. Hmm, okay, let me think through this step by step.

First off, let me make sure I understand the problem correctly. There are two candidates, let's call them Candidate A and Candidate B. Candidate A won the election and got 3/4 of the total votes. The total number of students who voted was 80. So, the rest of the votes went to Candidate B, who must be the loser. I need to figure out how many votes Candidate B received.

Alright, so total votes are 80. Candidate A got 3/4 of these votes. Let me write that down. So, if I denote the number of votes Candidate A got as V_A, then V_A = (3/4) * 80.

Let me compute that. 3/4 of 80. Well, 80 divided by 4 is 20, so 20 times 3 is 60. So,"
"Okay, let me try to figure this out. So, Sandra ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations. Hmm, so if I let the number of white carnations be some variable, maybe I can express the number of red roses in terms of that.

She also ordered 200 pink calla lilies, and that was five times the number of white carnations. So, if I let the number of white carnations be W, then the number of pink calla lilies is 5W. And we know the pink calla lilies are 200, so that means 5W = 200. Let me write that down.

5W = 200

So, to find W, I can divide both sides by 5.

W = 200 / 5
W = 40

Okay, so she ordered 40 white carnations. That makes sense. Now, since she ordered four times as many red roses as white carnations, the number of red roses would be 4 times W. Let's write that.

Red roses = 4 * W
Red roses = 4 * 40
Red roses = 160

"First, I need to determine the ages of Mark and Jan based on the given information.

Let's denote Mark's current age as \( M \) and Jan's current age as \( J \).

From the problem, I know that Jean is two years older than Mark. So, Jean's age \( J_e \) can be expressed as:
\[
J_e = M + 2
\]

Next, the problem states that two years ago, Mark was five years older than half of Jean's age at that time. Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \) and Jean's age was \( J_e - 2 \). According to the problem, we have the equation:
\[
M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}(J_e - 2)
\]

Since we already know that \( J_e = M + 2 \), I can substitute this into the second equation to solve for \( M \):
\[
M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}((M + 2) - 2)

\[
M - 2 = \frac{1}{2}M

"Okay, so I have this problem about a relay race between two teams, right? Both teams are running a 4 by 400 meter relay, which I assume means a 4-lap race on a standard track. Each team has four members, each running a 400-meter segment, which they call a lap. 

The first team is the faster one. Each of their four runners completes their 400-meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. So, that means every runner on the first team is equally fast, each taking 55 seconds per lap. That seems straightforward.

The second team is less well-rounded. Their first runner takes 60 seconds to run their lap. But each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one. So, the second runner on this team would take 57 seconds, the third 54 seconds, and the fourth 51 seconds. 

The question is asking how many seconds the faster team will win by. So, I need to figure out the total time each team takes to complete the relay and then subtract the two to find the difference.

"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 than two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, I'll start by calculating the probability of each event separately.

First, I'll find the probability of rolling a number greater than 3. A standard six-sided die has the numbers 1 through 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6, which gives me 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is 3/6, which simplifies to 1/2.

Next, I'll calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The even numbers on a die are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on a single roll is 3/6 or 1/2. Since each roll is independent, the probability of rolling an even number on the first roll multiplied by the probability of rolling an even number on the second roll is (1/2) * (1/2) = 1/4.

"First, I need to determine the total cost the trader incurred. This includes both the cost of purchasing the bags and the transportation fees.

Let’s denote the number of bags as \( x \).

The cost of purchasing the bags is \( 20x \) dollars.

The transportation cost for each bag is $2, so the total transportation cost is \( 2x \) dollars.

Therefore, the total cost is \( 20x + 2x = 22x \) dollars.

Next, I need to calculate the total revenue from selling the bags. The selling price per bag is $30, so the total revenue is \( 30x \) dollars.

The profit is the difference between the total revenue and the total cost. According to the problem, the profit is $400.

So, I can set up the equation:

"Okay, so I have this problem here about three friends who spent money on tickets to the fair, food, and some rides. I need to figure out how much each of them paid if they split all the costs evenly. Let me try to break this down step by step.

First, the problem says three friends spent $20.25 on 3 tickets to the fair. So, the total amount spent on tickets is $20.25. Since there are three friends, each ticket must have cost the same. Hmm, so I can find the cost per ticket by dividing $20.25 by 3. Let me write that down.

Total cost for tickets = $20.25  
Number of friends = 3  
Cost per ticket = Total cost / Number of friends = 20.25 / 3

Let me calculate that. 20 divided by 3 is about 6.666, and 0.25 divided by 3 is approximately 0.083. So adding those together, each ticket costs $6.75. Let me check that: 3 times 6.75 is 20.25. Yep, that works.

"Okay, so Brinley has taken five tests so far and now she has a sixth test coming up. She wants to have an average of 93 across all six tests. Let me figure out what she needs on her sixth test.

First, I should probably remember how averages work. The average is the total sum of all the tests divided by the number of tests. So, if she wants an average of 93 over six tests, I can calculate the total points she needs to have.

Let me write that down:

Desired average = 93
Number of tests = 6

Total points needed = Desired average * Number of tests = 93 * 6

Let me compute that:

93 * 6 = 558

So, Brinley needs a total of 558 points across all six tests.

Now, she already has five test scores: 89, 71, 92, 100, and 86. I should add those up to see how many points she already has.

"First, calculate the total cost of the items Sara wants to buy. The jacket costs $30, and each pair of shoes costs $20, so two pairs of shoes cost $40. Adding the jacket cost, the total is $70.

Sara already has $10 saved, so she needs an additional $60 to afford the jacket and shoes.

She earns money from babysitting and mowing lawns. From babysitting, she earns $5 per session, and from mowing lawns, she earns $4 per session.

Let \( x \) be the number of times she mows the lawn. The total additional money she will earn from mowing is \( 4x \).

"Okay, so I have this problem here about Jerry and his flock of chickens. Let me try to figure it out step by step. 

First, the problem says that red chickens produce 3 eggs a day, and white chickens produce 5 eggs a day. Jerry collects a total of 42 eggs every day. Also, it mentions that he has two more white chickens than red chickens. The question is asking how many red chickens he has.

Hmm, let's break this down. I think I can model this with some equations. Let me denote the number of red chickens as R and the number of white chickens as W. 

Since there are two more white chickens than red ones, I can write that as:
W = R + 2

That seems straightforward. 

Now, the total eggs produced per day is 42. Red chickens produce 3 eggs each, so the total eggs from red chickens would be 3R. Similarly, white chickens produce 5 eggs each, so their total would be 5W. 

Adding those together should give the total eggs Jerry collects:
3R + 5W = 42

"Okay, so Gary likes to walk around the edge of this park, and the park is a rectangle. The rectangle measures 1.5 miles by 6 miles. Hmm, I need to figure out how long it takes him to walk around the edge, given that he walks at 3 miles per hour. Alright, let me break this down step by step.

First, I remember that the distance around a rectangle is called the perimeter. So, I need to calculate the perimeter of the park. The formula for the perimeter of a rectangle is 2 times the length plus 2 times the width. Let me write that down:

Perimeter = 2 * length + 2 * width

Given that the length is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles, plugging those values in:

Perimeter = 2 * 6 + 2 * 1.5

Let me compute that. 2 times 6 is 12, and 2 times 1.5 is 3. So, adding those together:

Perimeter = 12 + 3 = 15 miles

Alright, so the perimeter of the park is 15 miles. That means Gary needs to walk 15 miles to go"

"First, Ram buys 25 pens. Each of these pens has a certain amount of ink, but he can mix the ink from five empty pens to make one full pen. 

To determine how many full pens he can make, I'll divide the total number of pens he bought by 5. That calculation gives 25 divided by 5, which equals 5. This means he can make 5 new pens from the ink in the original 25 pens.

After making these new pens, he can continue to mix the ink from these additional pens to create even more pens. Using the same logic, each new batch of 5 pens will produce 1 more full pen. 

This process can continue until he no longer has enough ink to make another full pen. Since each time he makes a new pen, he effectively reduces the number of pens he can make by a factor of 5, the total number of pens he can produce will be 5 raised to the power of the number of times he repeats this process.

Therefore, the total number of pens Ram will have is 5^4, which equals 625 pens.
