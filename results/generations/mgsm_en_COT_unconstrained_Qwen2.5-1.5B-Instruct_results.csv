"To determine how much Janet makes every day at the farmers' market, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total number of eggs laid by the ducks per day:**
   \[
   16 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

2. **Determine the number of eggs eaten by Janes's family members:**
   \[
   3 \text{ eggs/day} \times 7 \text{ people} = 21 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]
   (Assuming the family consists of 7 people)

3. **Determine the number of eggs used to bake muffins for friends:**
   \[
   4 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]

4. **Calculate the remaining eggs available for sale at the market:**
   \[
   16 \text{ eggs/day} - 21 \text{ eggs/day} = -5 \text{ eggs/day}
   \]
   This calculation shows a negative value, which indicates an error in the assumption about the number of eggs used for baking muffins. Since it's not possible to use more eggs than are available, let's re-evaluate the scenario.

5. **Re-evaluate the scenario"
"To determine the total number of bolts of fabric needed for the robe:

1. First, we know that a robe requires 2 bolts of blue fiber.
2. The amount of white fiber required is half of the blue fiber, which means 2/2 = 1 bolt of white fiber.
3. To find the total number of bolts, we add the blue fiber (2) to the white fiber (1): 2 + 1 = 3 bolts.

Therefore, it takes a total of 3 bolts of fabric to make the robe."
"To calculate the profit Josh made on the house flip, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the new value of the house after repairs:**  
   The original price of the house was $80,000, and Josh invested an additional $50,000 in repairs. Therefore, the total amount spent (original purchase price plus repair costs) is:
   
   \[
   80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000
   \]

   Since this increase in value represents a 150% increase over its original price, we can set up the following equation to find out what 150% of the original price would equal:

   \[
   130,000 = 1.5 \times \text{New Value}
   \]

   Solving for the New Value:

   \[
   \text{New Value} = \frac{130,000}{1.5} = 86,666.67
   \]

2. **Calculate the Profit:**
   To find the profit, subtract the initial investment from the final selling price:

"To calculate the total number of meters James runs in a week, you would multiply the number of sprints by the distance per sprint:

Number of sprints per week = 3
Distance per sprint = 60 meters

Total distance per week = Number of sprints per week × Distance per sprint
Total distance per week = 3 × 60 meters
Total distance per week = 180 meters

So, James runs a total of 180 meters every week."
"To determine how many cups of feed Wendi needs to give her chickens in the final meal of the day, we start by calculating the total amount of feed given out during the morning and afternoon sessions.

First, let's find out how much feed was given out in the morning:
\[ \text{Morning feed} = 15 \text{ cups} \]

Next, let's calculate the amount of feed given out in the afternoon:
\[ \text{Afternoon feed} = 25 \text{ cups} \]

Now, we add these amounts together to find the total feed given out over the two sessions:
\[ \text{Total feed} = \text{Morning feed} + \text{Afternoon feed} \]
\[ \text{Total feed} = 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} \]
\[ \text{Total feed} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

Since Wendi feeds each of her 20 chickens three cups of feed per day, we need to determine how much feed is needed for all 20 chickens in total:
\[ \text{Total feed required} = \text{Number of chickens} \times \text{Feed per chicken"
"To calculate the total amount Kylar needs to pay for the glasses, we first determine the price of each glass based on the given conditions:

- The first glass costs $5.
- Every second glass costs 60% of the original price, which is \( 5 \times 0.60 = \$3 \).

Now, we know that Kylar wants to buy 16 glasses. We can break this into groups of two (since every second glass is discounted):

1. First group of 2 glasses: \( 2 \times 5 = \$10 \)
2. Second group of 2 glasses: \( 2 \times 3 = \$6 \)

So far, we've accounted for all 16 glasses. Let's add these amounts together:

\( 10 + 6 = \$16 \)

Therefore, Kylar needs to pay a total of $16 for the glasses."
"To determine the number of sheep each city has, we start by identifying the given information:

1. Seattle has 20 sheep.
2. Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle.
3. Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston.

Let's calculate step by step:

### Step 1: Calculate the number of sheep in Charleston
Since Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle:
\[ \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times \text{Seattle's sheep} \]
\[ \text{Charleston's sheep} = 4 \times 20 \]
\[ \text{Charleston's sheep} = 80 \]

### Step 2: Calculate the number of sheep in Toulouse
Since Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston:
\[ \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times \text{Charleston's sheep} \]
\[ \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 2 \times 80 \]
\[ \text{Toulouse's sheep} = 160 \]

### Step 3: Sum up all the sheep
Now, add the number of sheep in Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle together:
\[ \text{Total sheep"
"To determine how long it will take Carla to finish downloading the 200 GB file, we need to break down the process into several steps:

### Step 1: Calculate the time taken to download the first half of the file (100 GB)

Since Carla's normal speed is 2 GB per minute, for the first half of the file (100 GB):

\[
\text{Time} = \frac{\text{File Size}}{\text{Download Speed}} = \frac{100 \text{ GB}}{2 \text{ GB/min}} = 50 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 2: Account for the Windows update

Windows forced a restart during the download, taking an additional 20 minutes:

\[
\text{Total Time After Restart} = 50 \text{ minutes} + 20 \text{ minutes} = 70 \text{ minutes}
\]

### Step 3: Calculate the remaining part of the file to be downloaded after the restart

After restarting, Carla starts again from the beginning. Therefore, she needs to download the second half of the file (another 100 GB):

\[
\text{Remaining Time} = \"
"To determine how far John is from home at the end of the 4 hours, we need to calculate the distance he covers in each segment of his trip:

1. **First Segment**: 
   - Distance covered: \( \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} = 60 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} = 180 \, \text{miles} \)

2. **Second Segment**:
   - Time spent in traffic: 2 hours
   - Speed during traffic: Not given directly; let's denote it as \( v_2 \).
   - Since no specific value for \( v_2 \) is provided, we cannot compute this segment without additional information. However, if we assume that the entire journey was planned such that the second segment could fit within the required 4 hours, we would proceed by assuming the maximum possible speed within the constraints. 

Given the problem statement, however, it seems an assumption or additional context about the speed during traffic might be necessary to accurately solve the question. Without this crucial detail, we can't complete the calculation fully."
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for this week, we need to consider both her regular hours and her overtime hours separately.

Regular Hours Earnings:
For the first 40 hours, she earns $10/hour. 
So, regular earnings = 40 hours * $10/hour = $400

Overtime Hours Earnings:
She worked 5 hours of overtime (45 total hours minus the first 40 regular hours).
Her overtime rate is 1.2 times her regular rate, which is 1.2 * $10 = $12/hour.
So, overtime earnings = 5 hours * $12/hour = $60

Total Earnings:
Adding the regular earnings and the overtime earnings gives us the total earnings.
Total earnings = Regular earnings + Overtime earnings
Total earnings = $400 + $60 = $460

Therefore, Eliza earned a total of $460 for this week."
"To find out how many downloads the program had in total over the three months, we need to calculate the number of downloads for each month separately and then add them together.

First Month: 
There were 60 downloads.

Second Month:
The number of downloads doubled from the previous month, which would be 60 x 3 = 180 downloads. However, this reduction by 30% makes it less than expected because 30% of 180 is 54, leaving us with 180 - 54 = 126 downloads.

Third Month:
In the third month, the number of downloads was reduced by 30%, making it 70% of the second month's count (since 100% - 30% = 70%). Therefore, the download count would be 126 x 0.7 = 88.2. Since you can't have a fraction of a download, we round down to 88 downloads.

Now, adding up all the downloads:

First Month: 60
Second Month: 126
Third Month: 88

Total Downloads = 60 + 126 + 8"
"First, we calculate the cost of the donuts:

- Toula bought 3 dozens of donuts.
- The cost per dozen donuts is $68.

Total cost of donuts = 3 dozens × $68/dozen

Next, we calculate the cost of the mini cupcakes:

- Toula bought 2 dozens of mini cupcakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cupcakes is $80.

Total cost of mini cupcakes = 2 dozens × $80/dozen

Then, we calculate the cost of the mini cheesecakes:

- Toula bought 6 dozens of mini cheesecakes.
- The cost per dozen mini cheesecakes is $55.

Total cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 dozens × $55/dozen

Finally, we add up all these costs to get the total amount spent by Toula:

Total cost = Total cost of donuts + Total cost of mini cupcakes + Total cost of mini cheesecakes

Let's perform the calculations:

Cost of donuts = 3 × $68 = $204

Cost of mini cupcakes = 2 × $80 = $160

Cost of mini cheesecakes = 6 × $55 = $33"
"To determine how many years it takes Carlos to start earning money from selling lemons, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years it will take to accumulate enough profit to cover the initial cost of planting the tree.

First, let's define the variables:
- Initial cost of planting the lemon tree: $90
- Annual growth rate of lemons: 7 lemons
- Selling price per lemon: $1.5
- Watering and feeding cost per year: $3

Next, let's calculate the annual revenue from selling lemons:

\[ \text{Annual Revenue} = (\text{Number of Lemons}) \times (\text{Selling Price per Lemon}) \]
\[ \text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times \$1.5 = \$10.5 \]

Now, let's calculate the annual expenses:

\[ \text{Annual Expenses} = (\text{Watering and Feeding Cost per Year}) \]
\[ \text{Annual Expenses} = \$3 \]

Net annual profit (or loss) is calculated as follows:

\[ \text{Net Annual Profit} = \text{Annual Revenue} - \text{Annual Expenses} \]

"To find out how many vacuum cleaners Melanie started with, let's work backwards through the problem:

1. At the orange house, Melanie sold half of what was left. Since she has 5 vacuum cleaners left after this step, before selling half, she must have had double that amount (because if she sells half, you're left with twice the original quantity). 
   5 x 2 = 10

2. Before reaching the orange house, she sold 2 vacuum cleaners to the red house. Therefore, before giving those away, she would have had:
   10 + 2 = 12

3. Finally, before going to the green house, she sold a third of her initial number of vacuum cleaners. To figure out how many that was, we divide by three:
   12 / 3 = 4

So, Melanie started with 4 vacuum cleaners."
"To find out what percentage of the students enrolled in hip-hop dance, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Total number of students**: 20

2. **Percentage enrolled in contemporary dance**:
   - Contemporary dance enrollment rate: 20%
   - Number of students in contemporary dance: \( 20 \times 0.20 = 4 \)

3. **Remaining students after contemporary dance**:
   - Total students minus those enrolled in contemporary dance: \( 20 - 4 = 16 \)

4. **Percentage enrolled in jazz dance**:
   - Jazz dance enrollment rate: 25%
   - Number of students in jazz dance: \( 16 \times 0.25 = 4 \)

5. **Percentage enrolled in hip-hop dance**:
   - Remaining students after contemporary and jazz dances: \( 16 - 4 = 12 \)
   - Percentage of students in hip-hop dance: \( \frac{12}{20} \times 100\% = 60\% \)

So, 60% of the entire students enrolled in hip-hop dance."
"To determine which purchase plan maximizes profit, we need to calculate the value of both options after accounting for their respective price increases.

**For Jewelry:**

- Initial Value: $5,000
- Increase Rate: 2.5%
- Increase Amount: \( \frac{2.5}{100} \times 5000 = 125 \)

So, the final value of the jewelry after the increase:

\( 5000 + 125 = 5125 \)

**For Electronic Gadgets:**

- Initial Value: $8,000
- Increase Rate: 1.2%
- Increase Amount: \( \frac{1.2}{100} \times 8000 = 96 \)

So, the final value of the electronic gadgets after the increase:

\( 8000 + 96 = 8096 \)

Comparing the values:

Jewelry: $5,125
Electronic Gadgets: $8,096

Therefore, the purchase plan for electronic gadgets yields a higher profit ($8,096) compared to purchasing jewelry ($5,125)."
"On the first day, both trains cover a combined distance of 80 + 80 = 160 miles. 

On the second day, both trains continue their journey and add another 150 miles together, bringing the total distance traveled by each train to 160 + 150 = 310 miles. 

So, each train covers a total distance of 310 miles over the two days."
"To calculate Jill's annual salary, we need to determine how much she earns from both teaching and coaching over the course of the year.

First, let's calculate her weekly earnings:

Teaching pay: \( 35 \text{ hours/week} \times \$20/\text{hour} = \$700/\text{week} \)

Cheerleading pay: \( 15 \text{ hours/week} \times \$30/\text{hour} = \$450/\text{week} \)

Now, add these together to get her total weekly earnings:

Total weekly earnings: \( \$700 + \$450 = \$1150 \)

Since she works 50 weeks a year, we multiply her total weekly earnings by the number of weeks:

Annual salary: \( \$1150/\text{week} \times 50 \text{ weeks/year} = \$57,500 \)

So, Jill's annual salary is $57,500."
"To find out how many dozens of eggs Claire eats in 4 weeks, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps:

1. **Calculate the number of eggs used per week:**
   - Claire makes a 3-egg omelet every morning.
   - There are 7 days in a week.
   - Therefore, the number of eggs used per week is \(3 \text{ eggs/omelet} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = 21 \text{ eggs/week}\).

2. **Calculate the number of eggs used in 4 weeks:**
   - The number of eggs used in 4 weeks is \(21 \text{ eggs/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks} = 84 \text{ eggs}\).

3. **Convert the total number of eggs to dozens:**
   - Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12 to get the number of dozens.
   - The number of dozens of eggs used in 4 weeks is \( \frac{84 \text{ eggs}}{12 \text{ eggs/dozen}} = 7 \text{ dozens}\).

So, Claire eats"
"To determine Marissa's required walking speed for the final portion of the hike, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total time needed to achieve an average speed of 4 miles per hour over the entire 12-mile hike.
2. Determine how long she has already spent on the first part of the hike.
3. Subtract the time already spent from the total travel time to find out how much time remains.
4. Divide the remaining distance by the remaining time to get the required speed.

First, let's calculate the total time needed for an average speed of 4 miles per hour over 12 miles:

\[ \text{Total time} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Average speed}} = \frac{12\ \text{miles}}{4\ \text{mph}} = 3\ \text{hours} \]

Next, we know she has already spent 1 hour on the first section and another hour on the second section:

\[ \text{Time already spent} = 1\ \text{hour} + 1\ \text{hour} = 2\ \text{hours} \]

Now, we subtract this time from the total time to find out how much"
"First, let's calculate the amount of water in the original orange drink:

- The orange drink contains 2/3 water.
- Therefore, in 10 liters of orange drink, there are \( \frac{2}{3} \times 10 = \frac{20}{3} \) liters of water.

Next, we need to account for the fact that you spilled one liter of the orange drink. This will remove one liter from both the total volume and the water content. 

So, the new volume of the orange drink is 9 liters (since 1 liter was removed), and the new amount of water in this reduced volume is \( \frac{20}{3} - 1 = \frac{20}{3} - \frac{3}{3} = \frac{17}{3} \) liters.

Now, let's consider the pineapple drink. It starts out as 15 liters of a mixture where 3/5 is water. We'll first determine how much water is in the initial 15 liters:

- The initial mix of the pineapple drink is 3/5 water.
- Thus, in 15 liters of pineapple drink, there are \( \frac{3}{"
"To determine how many years ago Raymond's son was born, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine Raymond's current age**:
   - Samantha is currently 31 years old.
   - Raymond was born 6 years before Samantha.
   - Therefore, Raymond's current age is \(31 - 6 = 25\) years old.

2. **Calculate when Raymond's son was born**:
   - Raymond's son was born when Raymond was 23 years old.
   - The difference between Raymond's current age (25) and the year he became his son's father (23) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     25 - 23 = 2
     \]

So, Raymond's son was born 2 years ago."
"To determine how many DVDs Billy sold on Tuesday, we need to add up the number of DVDs purchased by each group of customers.

First, let's calculate the number of DVDs sold:

1. The first three customers each buy one DVD:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 1 \text{ DVD/customer} = 3 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

2. The next two customers each buy two DVDs:
   \[
   2 \text{ customers} \times 2 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 4 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

3. The last three customers do not buy any DVDs:
   \[
   3 \text{ customers} \times 0 \text{ DVDs/customer} = 0 \text{ DVDs}
   \]

Now, we sum these amounts to find the total number of DVDs sold:

\[
3 \text{ DVDs} + 4 \text{ DVDs} + 0 \text{ DVDs} = 7 \text{ DVDs}
\]

Therefore, Billy sold a total of 7 DVDs on Tuesday."
"To determine how many centimeters shorter the candle will be after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, we need to calculate the total time the candle was burning and then use this information to find out how much the candle melted.

First, let's figure out how long the candle burned:

From 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM is a span of 4 hours (since both times are on the same day).

Next, since the candle melts by 2 centimeters every hour, we multiply the number of hours it burned by the rate of melting per hour:

\( 4 \text{ hours} \times 2 \text{ cm/hour} = 8 \text{ cm} \)

So, after burning from 1:00 PM to 5:00 PM, the candle will be 8 centimeters shorter than when it was initially lit."
"To find the original price of the book before the discount, we need to work backwards from the sale price using the information about the discount rate.

Let \( P \) represent the original price of the book.

Given that the book was sold for $19.50 after a 25% discount, this means that $19.50 represents 75% (or 100% - 25%) of its original price \( P \).

We set up the equation:

\[ 0.75P = \$19.50 \]

Now, solve for \( P \):

\[ P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \]
\[ P = \$26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."
"To determine how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, we first need to calculate the total cost of the items she purchased other than the pizzas.

First, let's calculate the cost of the milk:
\[ 5 \text{ packs} \times \$3 \text{ per pack} = \$15 \]

Next, let's calculate the cost of the apples:
\[ 4 \text{ apples} \times \$1.50 \text{ per apple} = \$6 \]

Now, add these amounts together to find out how much was spent on the non-pizza items:
\[ \$15 + \$6 = \$21 \]

We know that Marie paid a total of \$50, so subtract the amount already accounted for (the cost of the chicken meal and the milk) from the total amount paid to find the cost of the pizzas:
\[ \$50 - \$21 = \$29 \]

Each box of pizza costs \$8.50, so to find out how many boxes of pizza Marie ordered, divide the total cost of the pizzas by the price per box:
\[ \frac{\$29}{\$8.50 \text{ per box}} = 3.42857 \approx"
"To find out how much Mishka spent on all the clothing items, we need to calculate the total cost of each type of clothing item separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the total cost of the shorts:

Cost of one pair of shorts = $16.50
Number of pairs of shorts = 3

Total cost of shorts = Cost per pair × Number of pairs
                     = $16.50 × 3
                     = $49.50

Next, let's calculate the total cost of the pants:

Cost of one pair of pants = $22.50
Number of pairs of pants = 3

Total cost of pants = Cost per pair × Number of pairs
                    = $22.50 × 3
                    = $67.50

Finally, let's calculate the total cost of the shoes:

Cost of one pair of shoes = $42
Number of pairs of shoes = 3

Total cost of shoes = Cost per pair × Number of pairs
                    = $42 × 3
                    = $126

Now, let's add up the totals for all the clothing items:

"To determine how much Cynthia will spend on ice cream over 60 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of servings Cynthia consumes in 60 days**:
   Since Cynthia eats one serving every night, in 60 days, she will consume \( 60 \) servings.

2. **Determine the number of cartons needed**:
   Each carton contains \( 15 \) servings. To find out how many cartons are required, divide the total servings by the number of servings per carton:
   \[
   \frac{60}{15} = 4 \text{ cartons}
   \]

3. **Calculate the total cost**:
   The price of each carton is \( \$4.00 \). Multiply this price by the number of cartons purchased:
   \[
   4 \text{ cartons} \times \$4.00/\text{carton} = \$16.00
   \]

Therefore, Cynthia will spend **\$16.00** on ice cream over 60 days."
"To find out how many miles Henry traveled between his first and second stops, we need to subtract the distance of his first stop from the total distance of the trip minus his second stop.

First, let's calculate the total distance covered by the time he reached his second stop:

Total trip length = 60 miles

Distance of second stop = 15 miles

So, the remaining distance before reaching the second stop would be:

Remaining distance = Total trip length - Distance of second stop
Remaining distance = 60 miles - 15 miles
Remaining distance = 45 miles

Now, we know that Henry made a stop after 20 miles, which means before this stop, he had already covered 20 miles. Therefore, the distance between his first and second stops would be:

Distance between first and second stops = Remaining distance - Distance after first stop
Distance between first and second stops = 45 miles - 20 miles
Distance between first and second stops = 25 miles

So, Henry traveled 25 miles between his first and second stops."
"Let's denote the price of the boots by \( B \). The prices of the two pairs of high heels are given as follows:

- One pair of high heels costs $33.
- The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, which means it costs \( 2 \times 33 = \$66 \).

According to the problem, the combined cost of these two pairs of high heels is five dollars less than the price of the boots. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ 33 + 66 = B - 5 \]

Now let's solve this equation step by step.

First, add the costs of the two pairs of high heels:

\[ 33 + 66 = 99 \]

So, the equation becomes:

\[ 99 = B - 5 \]

Next, add 5 to both sides of the equation to isolate \( B \):

\[ 99 + 5 = B \]
\[ 104 = B \]

Thus, the price of the boots is \( \$104 \).

To verify our solution, check if the sum of the costs of the two pairs of high heels equals the cost of the boots minus $5:

"
"Let Darrell's age be \( 7x \) and Allen's age be \( 11x \). According to the problem, their combined age is 162:

\[ 7x + 11x = 162 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ 18x = 162 \]
\[ x = \frac{162}{18} \]
\[ x = 9 \]

Now we know:

- Darrell's current age is \( 7x = 7 \times 9 = 63 \)
- Allen's current age is \( 11x = 11 \times 9 = 99 \)

To find Allen's age 10 years from now, add 10 to his current age:

\[ 99 + 10 = 109 \]

So, Allen will be 109 years old 10 years from now."
"To find the average guess, we need to calculate the guesses of all three friends and then divide by the number of friends (which is 3).

First friend's guess: 80

Second friend's guess: 20 more than half of the first friend's guess.
Half of 80 is 40, and adding 20 gives us 60.

Third friend's guess: 25% more than the first friend's guess.
25% of 80 is 0.25 * 80 = 20. Adding this to the original amount gives us 80 + 20 = 100.

Now let's add up these guesses: 80 + 60 + 100 = 240.

Finally, we divide this sum by the number of friends to get the average:

Average guess = Total guesses / Number of friends
Average guess = 240 / 3
Average guess = 80

So, the average guess is 80 jelly beans."
"To calculate the number of hours John spends on dog care per week:

1. First, we need to determine the daily time spent on each dog. According to the information provided, it's 0.5 hours per day.

2. Since John takes care of 10 dogs, we multiply the daily time by the number of dogs to find out the total daily time spent:

   Total daily time = 0.5 hours/day/dog × 10 dogs

   Total daily time = 5 hours/day

3. To find the weekly time, we multiply the daily time by the number of days in a week (assuming a standard 7-day week):

   Weekly time = 5 hours/day/week × 7 days/week

   Weekly time = 35 hours/week

So, John spends 35 hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as S and the number of gold coins as G.

According to the information given:

1) The total number of coins is 110:
   S + G = 110

2) There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins:
   G = S + 30

We can substitute the second equation into the first one to solve for S:

S + (S + 30) = 110
2S + 30 = 110
2S = 110 - 30
2S = 80
S = 40

Now we know there are 40 silver coins. We can find the number of gold coins by substituting S back into the second equation:

G = S + 30
G = 40 + 30
G = 70

Therefore, Gretchen has 70 gold coins."
"First, we need to find out how many jewels Aaron has. According to the problem, Aaron has 5 more jewels than half of Raymond's jewels. 

Half of Raymond's jewels (which is 40/2) equals 20. Adding 5 more gives us:

Aaron's jewels = 20 + 5 = 25

Now, since Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron, we subtract 2 from Aaron's number of jewels:

Siobhan's jewels = Aaron's jewels - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23

So, Siobhan has 23 jewels."
"In the second 20 minutes, Mike scored 25% more than in the first 20 minutes, which is an additional 25/100 * 4 = 1 point.
So in the second 20 minutes, he scored a total of 4 + 1 = 5 points.
Therefore, in total, Mike scored 4 + 5 = 9 points during the game."
"To find out how much Terry spends on yogurt over 30 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of yogurts Terry eats per day:**
   \[
   \text{Number of yogurts Terry eats per day} = 2
   \]

2. **Determine the number of days Terry will eat yogurts:**
   \[
   \text{Number of days} = 30
   \]

3. **Find out how many sets of 4 yogurts Terry consumes over 30 days:**
   \[
   \frac{\text{Total number of days}}{\text{Yogurts per set}} = \frac{30}{4}
   \]
   Since Terry cannot buy partial sets of 4 yogurts, we'll consider whole numbers of sets:
   \[
   \frac{30}{4} = 7.5
   \]
   This means Terry gets 7 full sets of 4 yogurts and an additional half set (which doesn't count as a complete set).

4. **Calculate the total number of yogurts Terry consumes over 30 days:**

"First, we calculate the total amount of money John made from selling his Lego sets:

\[ \text{Total money from Lego} = 13 \times 15 = \$195 \]

Next, we determine how much money was spent on buying the video games:

\[ \text{Money spent on video games} = 8 \times 20 = \$160 \]

After buying the video games, we subtract the cost from the money John initially had:

\[ \text{Remaining money} = 195 - 160 = \$35 \]

Since John ended up with $5 left after buying the video games, it confirms our calculation as he indeed used all the remaining money ($35) to purchase the video games (which cost $35). 

Now, to find out how many Lego sets John has left, we divide the remaining money by the price per set:

\[ \text{Number of Lego sets left} = \frac{35}{15} = 2 \text{ sets} \]

So, John has 2 Lego sets left."
"To find out how fast John runs, we need to calculate the total time he spends running over the course of a week.

First, let's determine how long he runs on each of the three days:

- Day 1: He runs for 3 hours.
- Day 2: Half as much as Day 1, which is \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.
- Day 3: Again, half as much as Day 1, which is also \( \frac{3}{2} = 1.5 \) hours.

Now, add up all the hours he runs over the three days:

\( 3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \) hours

Next, divide this total by the number of days (which is 3):

\( \frac{6}{3} = 2 \)

So, John runs at a speed of 2 miles per hour."
"First, we need to find Dana's running speed. Since she can skip at half the speed of running, we divide her skipping speed by 2:

\[ \text{Running Speed} = \frac{\text{Skipping Speed}}{2} = \frac{3\text{ mph}}{2} = 1.5\text{ mph} \]

Now, since Dana runs at four times the speed of walking, we multiply her running speed by 4:

\[ \text{Walking Speed} = 1.5\text{ mph} \times 4 = 6\text{ mph} \]

Next, let's calculate the distance she covers during each activity. We know she spends one-third of the time running and two-thirds of the time walking over a period of six hours. 

For running:
\[ \text{Time Running} = \frac{1}{3} \times 6\text{ hours} = 2\text{ hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance Running} = \text{Speed Running} \times \text{Time Running} = 1.5\text{ mph} \times 2\text{ hours} = 3\text{ miles} \]

For walking"
"To find out how old Brandon's iPhone is, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the age of Ben's iPhone**:
   - We know that Ben's iPhone is two times older than Suzy's iPhone.
   - Suzy's iPhone is 1 year old.
   - Therefore, Ben's iPhone is \(2 \times 1\) years old.
   \[
   \text{Ben's iPhone} = 2 \times 1 = 2 \text{ years}
   \]

2. **Determine the age of Brandon's iPhone**:
   - We know that Brandon's iPhone is four times as old as Ben's iPhone.
   - Ben's iPhone is 2 years old.
   - Therefore, Brandon's iPhone is \(4 \times 2\) years old.
   \[
   \text{Brandon's iPhone} = 4 \times 2 = 8 \text{ years}
   \]

So, Brandon's iPhone is 8 years old."
"When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can throw the javelin three times farther than when not holding it. Since she can throw the javelin 400 feet without the gemstone, throwing it three times farther would mean she can throw it:

400 feet * 3 = 1200 feet

This distance is well beyond the reach of the dragon's flames, which are only 1000 feet away. Therefore, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can stand up to 1200 feet outside of the dragon's flames and still hit the dragon with the gold javelin."
There were a total of 5 x 8 = 40 pieces of pie baked by Grandma Jones. The number of pieces taken by the guests was therefore 40 – 14 = 26.
"To determine how many grams of chips you can eat given your daily calorie target, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Daily Calories Needed**: 
   Your daily calorie target is 2000 calories.

2. **Subtract Already Consumed Calories**:
   You've already consumed 1800 calories.

3. **Determine Remaining Calories Allowable**:
   \[
   \text{Remaining Calories} = \text{Total Daily Calorie Target} - \text{Calories Already Consumed}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining Calories} = 2000 - 1800 = 200 \text{ calories}
   \]

4. **Convert Remaining Calories to Grams of Chips**:

   To find out how many grams you can consume with 200 calories remaining:
   
   First, calculate how many grams correspond to 200 calories:
   \[
   \text{Grams Per Calorie} = \frac{\text{Weight of Bag}}{\text{Calories per"
"To calculate Charlie's net profit, we need to consider both the revenue from selling the candles and the costs associated with making them.

First, let's determine the number of candles Charlie can produce with one pound of beeswax:

For every pound of beeswax, Charlie can make 10 tapered candles.

Now, let's find out how many pounds of beeswax are needed to make 20 candles:

\[
\text{Pounds per candle} = \frac{\text{Total candles}}{\text{Candles per pound}}
\]

\[
\text{Pounds per candle} = \frac{20}{10} = 2 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total cost of making 20 candles:

Cost of wax and wicks per pound = $10.00

Since it takes 2 pounds of wax and wicks to make 20 candles:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Pounds per candle} \times \text{Cost per pound}
\]
\[
\text{Total cost} = 2 \times 10 = \$20.00
\]

Now, let's calculate the revenue from selling"
"To calculate the total number of hours Meredith spent writing articles over the three days, we need to determine the number of articles she wrote each day and then multiply by the time it took to write each one.

First, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Tuesday:

On Monday, she wrote 5 articles.
On Tuesday, she wrote \( \frac{2}{5} \) times more articles than on Monday, which means she wrote \( 5 + (5 \times \frac{2}{5}) = 5 + 2 = 7 \) articles.

Now, let's find out how many articles she wrote on Wednesday:

On Wednesday, she wrote twice the number of articles she wrote on Tuesday, which means she wrote \( 2 \times 7 = 14 \) articles.

Finally, let's add up all the articles she wrote over the three days:

Total articles written = Articles on Monday + Articles on Tuesday + Articles on Wednesday
Total articles written = 5 + 7 + 14

Now we perform the addition:

Total articles written = 5 + 7 + 14 = 26 articles

Since each article takes 4 hours to write, we can calculate the total hours spent writing:

"To find out how many post-it notes Candice purchased, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start by noting down the initial number of post-it notes she had: 80.
2. Add the post-it notes used while working at the coffee shop (220): 80 + 220 = 300.
3. We know that after all this, she had 23 post-it notes remaining. To find out how many she purchased, we subtract the total used from the remaining ones: 300 - 23 = 277.

So, Candice purchased 277 post-it notes in the package she bought at the store."
"Let's denote the number of blue ties John bought as B. Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he would buy 2B red ties.

The cost of a blue tie is $40. Therefore, the total amount spent on blue ties is:

Total cost on blue ties = Number of blue ties × Cost per blue tie
Total cost on blue ties = B × $40

Now we know that John spent $200 on blue ties. So,

B × $40 = $200
B = $200 / $40
B = 5

So, John bought 5 blue ties.

Since he buys twice as many red ties as blue ties, he would buy:

Red ties = 2 × Blue ties
Red ties = 2 × 5
Red ties = 10

Each red tie costs 50% more than a blue tie. A blue tie costs $40, so a red tie costs:

Cost of one red tie = Cost of one blue tie + (50% of Cost of one blue tie)
Cost of one red tie = $40 + ($40 × 0.5)
Cost of one red tie = $40"
"To find out how many pieces Tracy obtained, we need to convert all measurements to the same unit and then divide the length of the wire by the length of each piece.

Firstly, let's convert the length of the wire from feet to inches because the length of each piece is given in inches. 

There are 12 inches in one foot, so:

4 feet × 12 inches/foot = 48 inches

Now, we divide this total length by the length of each piece:

48 inches ÷ 6 inches/piece = 8 pieces

So, Tracy obtained 8 pieces of wire."
"First, we need to determine the total number of units in the building. Since there are 15 floors and each floor contains 8 units:

Total units = Floors × Units per Floor
             = 15 × 8
             = 120 units

Next, we calculate the number of units that are occupied by finding 3/4 of the total units:

Occupied units = Total units × (Fraction Occupied)
               = 120 × (3/4)
               = 90 units

To find the number of unoccupied units, subtract the number of occupied units from the total number of units:

Unoccupied units = Total units - Occupied units
                = 120 - 90
                = 30 units

So, there are 30 unoccupied units in the building."
"To determine how much Lloyd makes on eggs per week, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day.
2. Determine the daily earnings by multiplying the number of dozens by the price per dozen.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7) to find the weekly earnings.

Let's go through this step-by-step:

1. **Calculate the number of dozens of eggs produced per day**:
   - Since one dozen equals 12 eggs, we divide the total number of eggs by 12.
   \[
   \text{Number of dozens} = \frac{\text{Total eggs}}{12} = \frac{252}{12}
   \]

2. **Determine the daily earnings**:
   - We multiply the number of dozens by the price per dozen ($2).
   \[
   \text{Daily earnings} = (\text{Number of dozens}) \times \$2
   \]

3. **Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7)**:
   \[
   \text{Weekly earnings} = \text{Daily earnings} \times 7

"To determine how long it takes Tom to return to his starting point, we need to calculate the time spent traveling both to and from the destination.

First, let's find out how far Tom needs to travel:

Distance = Speed × Time

Since Tom is traveling from location 1 to location 4 (assuming these locations are on a straight line), the distance between them is not given directly. However, since this information isn't provided, we'll assume the problem is asking about the round trip, which would cover twice the distance between locations 1 and 4.

Let's denote the distance between locations 1 and 4 as \( d \).

Time taken to travel from 1 to 4:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{one way}} = \frac{d}{10} \]

Time taken to travel back from 4 to 1:
\[ \text{Time}_{\text{return}} = \frac{d}{6} \]

Now, to find the total time for the round trip, add the one-way times together:

\[ \text{Total Time} = \text{Time}_{\text{one way}} + \text{Time}_{\text{return}} \]
\[ \text{Total Time} = \"
"First find the total weight of Uriah's comic books by multiplying the number of comic books by their weight per book: 30 books * 1/4 pound/book = 7.5 pounds

Then subtract the weight of the comic books from the target weight decrease to find the remaining weight decrease needed: 15 pounds - 7.5 pounds = 7.5 pounds

Now divide this amount by the weight of a toy to find out how many toys Uriah needs to remove: 7.5 pounds / (1/2) pound/toy = 15 toys

So Uriah needs to remove 15 toys from his bag."
"On Thursday, the mechanic earned $60 per truck tire and repaired 6 of them, which amounts to 6 * $60 = $360. 

He also earned $40 per car tire and repaired 4 of them, which amounts to 4 * $40 = $160.

So on Thursday, the mechanic earned a total of $360 + $160 = $520.

On Friday, the mechanic didn't repair any truck tires, but he repaired all 12 car tires, earning him 12 * $40 = $480.

Therefore, the difference in revenue between Thursday and Friday was $520 (Thursday) - $480 (Friday) = $40.

Hence, the mechanic earned $40 more on Thursday than on Friday."
"To find out how many kittens the Doubtfire family now has, we need to add up all the kittens they have:

   \[
   \text{Number of lollipops eaten by Jean} = 2
   \]
   \[
   \text{Remaining lollipops} = 30 - 2 = 28

2. **Calculate how many bags can be filled with the remaining lollipops if each bag contains 2 lollipops:**
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{\text{Remaining lollipops}}{\text{Lollipops per bag}}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Number of bags} = \frac{28}{2}

"To find out how many boxes can fit on the bridge without exceeding its weight limit, we first need to subtract the weight of the driver and the empty truck from the bridge's maximum capacity:

\[ \text{Bridge Capacity} = 5000 \text{ pounds} \\
\text{Driver's Weight} = 3755 \text{ pounds} \\
\]

Subtracting the driver's weight from the bridge's capacity gives us the remaining weight space available for the boxes:

\[ \text{Remaining Space} = 5000 \text{ pounds} - 3755 \text{ pounds} = 1245 \text{ pounds} \\]

Each box weighs 15 pounds, so to determine how many boxes can fit into the remaining space, we divide the remaining space by the weight per box:

\[ \text{Number of Boxes} = \frac{\text{Remaining Space}}{\text{Weight per Box}} = \frac{1245}{15} = 83 \]

Therefore, the maximum number of boxes that can be loaded onto the truck without exceeding the bridge's weight limit is **83**."

"To find out how many oranges are good, we need to subtract the number of bad, unripe, and sour oranges from the total number of oranges.

First, let's determine the percentage of unripe and sour oranges:

- 20% are unripe,
- 2 are sour,

Adding these together gives us the total percentage of unripe and sour oranges:
\[ 20\% + 2\% = 22\% \]

This means that \(100\% - 22\% = 78\%\) are good oranges.

Now, let's calculate how many oranges this represents:

\[ 78\% \text{ of } 25 = \frac{78}{100} \times 25 \]
\[ = 0.78 \times 25 \]
\[ = 19.5 \]

Since you cannot have half an orange, it implies that there must be a mistake or rounding involved. However, based on the given information and assuming no rounding errors, the calculation suggests there would be approximately 19.5 oranges, which isn't practical since you can't have half an orange.

If we assume the numbers provided (25 oranges"

"To calculate Marcy's annual pension if she quits after 30 years, we first need to determine the amount of her pension before she starts receiving it annually starting from age 21. 

Given that she receives a fixed annual pension of $50,000 starting at age 21, let's break down the calculation:

1. **Pension for the first 20 years**: Since she worked for 20 years, she received this fixed amount each year for those 20 years. The total pension during these 20 years would be $50,000 times 20 years, which equals $1,000,000.

2. **Pension for the next 10 years (ages 21 to 30)**: At this point, she begins receiving 5% of the initial pension ($50,000) as a yearly increment. This amounts to 5% of $50,000, or $2,500 per year. Over 10 years, this adds up to $2,500 multiplied by 10, which gives us $25,000.

3. **Total pension"
"To find out the total amount Aleena paid for the streaming service by the end of the year, we need to break down the payment into two parts:

1. The first half of the year's subscription fee.
2. The second half of the year's subscription fee, which includes an additional charge (10%) due to the discount.

First, let's calculate the monthly rate without any discounts or increases. Since there are 12 months in a year, the monthly rate would be \( \frac{140}{12} \).

Next, we'll apply the 10% discount to the second half of the year's subscription fee. 

Finally, we'll add both halves together to get the total amount paid.

Let's perform these calculations step by step using Python code.
```python
# Calculate the monthly rate without any discounts or increases
monthly_rate = 140 / 12

# Apply the 10% discount to the second half of the year's subscription fee

"To determine how many miles Sophia can drive on a single tank of gas, we need to calculate the fuel efficiency of her car based on the information given:

1. **Miles Driven**: 100 miles
2. **Gallons Used**: 4 gallons

We can use these values to find out how many miles per gallon (mpg) her car gets by dividing the distance driven by the number of gallons used:

\[
\text{Miles Per Gallon} = \frac{\text{Miles Driven}}{\text{Gallons Used}}
\]

Substituting the known values into this equation gives us:

\[
\text{Miles Per Gallon} = \frac{100 \text{ miles}}{4 \text{ gallons}} = 25 \text{ mpg}
\]

This tells us that Sophia's car gets 25 miles per gallon. To find out how far she can drive on a full tank, which holds 12 gallons, we multiply the miles per gallon by the capacity of the tank:

\[
\text{Distance on Full Tank} = \text{Miles Per Gallon} \times \text{Tank Capacity}

"First, let's calculate how long Jim spends reading in one session:

Reading time per session = Half of TV watching time
                         = (1/2) * 2 hours
                         = 1 hour

Now, we know he repeats this process 3 times a week. So, we multiply the reading time by the number of sessions:

Total reading time per week = Reading time per session * Number of sessions per week
                          = 1 hour/session * 3 sessions/week
                          = 3 hours/week

Next, we need to find out how much time he spends on these activities over four weeks:

Total time spent per week = Total reading time per week * Number of weeks
                        = 3 hours/week * 4 weeks
                        = 12 hours

So, in 4 weeks, Jim spends a total of 12 hours watching TV and reading."
"To determine the total number of people who have all the schools sent, we need to consider both the players on the teams and the coaches.

First, let's calculate the number of players:

Each school has one girl's team with 5 players and one boy's team with 5 players, making it 5 girls' players + 5 boys' players = 10 players per school. Since there are four schools, the total number of players is 10 players/school × 4 schools = 40 players.

Next, we'll calculate the number of coaches:

Each school sends one coach for their team, and since there are four schools, there will be 4 coaches.

Now, we add up all these numbers:

Players (40) + Coaches (4) = Total People

Total People = 40 + 4 = 44

Therefore, there are 44 people who have all the schools sent to the basketball tournament."
"To find out how many gems were in the chest, we need to calculate the number of each type of gem separately and then add them together.

First, let's determine the number of rubies:

There were 35 fewer rubies than diamonds, so we subtract 35 from the number of diamonds:

Rubies = Diamonds - 35
Rubies = 175 - 35
Rubies = 140

Now, let's find out the number of emeralds:

There are twice as many emeralds as rubies, so we multiply the number of rubies by 2:

Emeralds = Rubies * 2
Emeralds = 140 * 2
Emeralds = 280

Finally, we add up all the gems:

Total Gems = Diamonds + Rubies + Emeralds
Total Gems = 175 + 140 + 280
Total Gems = 595

So, there were 595 gems in the chest."
"To determine the number of teachers at Dr. Wertz's school, we first need to find out the total number of students by adding the number of boys and girls together.

Given:
- Number of girls = 60
- Twice as many boys as girls

First, calculate the number of boys:
\[
\text{Number of boys} = 2 \times \text{Number of girls} = 2 \times 60 = 120

\[ \text{Total allowance} = \text{weekly allowance} \times \text{number of weeks} \]

\[ \text{Total allowance} = \$5 \times 8 \]

\[ \text{Total allowance} = \$40 \]

Now, we know that at the end of 8 weeks, Bailey had a total of $100. To find out how much money she started with, we subtract the total allowance from the final amount:

\[ \text{Initial amount} = \text{Final amount} - \text{Total allowance} \]

\[ \text{Initial amount} = \$100 - \$40 \]

\[ \text{Initial amount} = \$60 \]

So, Bailey started with $60."
"To determine how much money Judy makes in one week, we need to calculate the number of classes she teaches each day and then multiply by the number of students and the amount she charges per student.

First, let's find out how many classes Judy teaches during the weekdays (Monday through Friday):

\[ \text{Weekday Classes} = 5 \text{ classes/day} \times 5 \text{ days/week} = 25 \text{ classes/week} \]

Next, we add the classes she teaches on Saturday:

\[ \text{Saturday Classes} = 8 \text{ classes} \]

Now, let's calculate the total number of classes she teaches in a week:

\[ \text{Total Week Classes} = \text{Weekday Classes} + \text{Saturday Classes} = 25 + 8 = 33 \text{ classes/week} \]

Each class has 15 students, so the total number of students she teaches in a week is:

\[ \text{Total Students} = \text{Total Week Classes} \times 15 \text{ students/class} = 33 \times 15 = 495 \text{ students/week} \]

"To determine the total number of instructions Kelian needs to read to prepare both dishes, we'll follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of instructions in the first recipe.
   The first recipe has 20 instructions.

2. Calculate the number of instructions in the second recipe.
   Since the second recipe has twice as many instructions as the first one, we multiply the number of instructions in the first recipe by 2:
   \[
   20 \times 2 = 40
   \]
   Therefore, the second recipe has 40 instructions.

3. Add the number of instructions from both recipes together to find the total number of instructions Kelian needs to read:
   \[
   20 + 40 = 60
   \]

So, Kelian has to read a total of \boxed{60} instructions to prepare the two dishes."
"To calculate how much money Tommy raises from selling brownies and cheesecakes, we need to multiply the number of each type of baked good sold by its price and then add the totals together.

For the brownies:
\( \text{Money from brownies} = \text{Number of brownies} \times \text{Price per brownie} \)
\( \text{Money from brownies} = 43 \times \$3 \)
\( \text{Money from brownies} = \$129 \)

For the cheesecakes:
\( \text{Money from cheesecakes} = \text{Number of cheesecakes} \times \text{Price per cheesecake} \)
\( \text{Money from cheesecakes} = 23 \times \$4 \)
\( \text{Money from cheesecakes} = \$92 \)

Now, let's add the amounts from both types of desserts:

\( \text{Total money raised} = \text{Money from brownies} + \text{Money from cheesecakes} \)
\( \text{Total money raised} = \$129 + \$92 \)
\( \text{Total money raised} = \$22"
"To determine how much Shiela will pay each month for 3 months, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total cost of the cell phones before interest:**
   \[
   \text{Total cost} = 5 \times \$150 = \$750
   \]

2. **Determine the total amount of interest:**
   Since a 2% interest rate applies per unit, the total interest on all five cell phones is:
   \[
   \text{Total interest} = 5 \times (\$150 \times 0.02) = 5 \times \$3 = \$15
   \]

3. **Calculate the total payment including interest:**
   Add the total interest to the original total cost:
   \[
   \text{Total payment} = \$750 + \$15 = \$765
   \]

4. **Divide the total payment by the number of installments (months):**
   Since the payments are made over 3 months, divide the total payment by 3:
   \[
   \text{Monthly payment} = \frac{\$765}{3} = \$255

"First, we need to round the prices to the nearest dollar:

- Marigolds: $2.74 rounds up to $3
- Petunias: $1.87 rounds down to $1
- Begonias: $2.12 rounds up to $2

Now we calculate the revenue for each type of flower:

- Marigolds: 12 pots * $3/pot = $36
- Petunias: 9 pots * $1/pot = $9
- Begonias: 17 pots * $2/pot = $34

Finally, we add these amounts together to find the total revenue:

$36 (marigolds) + $9 (petunias) + $34 (begonias) = $79

So, Artie will make $79 from selling the flowers."
"To find the average square footage per level, we first need to calculate the total square footage of all levels combined. Given that each level has half the square footage of the level below it:

Level 1 (Top Level): 16 square feet

Level 2: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 16 = 8 \) square feet

Level 3: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) square feet

Level 4: \( \frac{1}{2} \times 4 = 2 \) square feet

Now, add up the square footages of all four levels:

\( 16 + 8 + 4 + 2 = 30 \) square feet

Since Luke built 4 levels, divide the total square footage by the number of levels to find the average:

\( \text{Average Square Footage Per Level} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \)

So, the average square footage per level is 7.5 square feet."
"To determine how many bags of dog food Cecilia will use in the first year, we need to break down the feeding schedule into parts and calculate the number of bags required for each part separately before summing them up.

### Step 1: Calculate the amount of dog food needed for the first 180 days

For the first 180 days, Cecilia feeds the puppy 1 cup per day. Therefore, the total amount of dog food needed over this period is:

\[ 1 \text{ cup/day} \times 180 \text{ days} = 180 \text{ cups} \]

### Step 2: Calculate the remaining time for which the puppy needs feeding

Since Cecilia's puppy was born today, it would take another \(365 - 180 = 185\) days until the next birthday (assuming a standard calendar year).

### Step 3: Determine the daily feeding rate for the remaining time

After the first 180 days, the puppy will continue to eat 2 cups per day. The remaining 185 days mean the puppy will consume:

\[ 2 \text{ cups/day} \times 185 \text{ days}"
"To find out how much laundry each person does, we need to first establish a relationship between their laundry loads based on the given information:

1. Let's denote the amount of laundry David does by \(D\).
2. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, the amount of laundry Sarah does (\(S\)) is \(4D\).
3. The problem states that Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah. Thus, the amount of laundry Raymond does (\(R\)) is \(\frac{1}{2}S\).

Given that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry (\(S = 400\) pounds), we can find the amounts done by David and Raymond using these relationships.

First, let's determine how much laundry David does (\(D\)):
\[ S = 4D \]
Since \(S = 400\) pounds,
\[ 400 = 4D \]
Divide both sides by 4 to solve for \(D\):
\[ D = \frac{400}{4} = 100 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, let's find out how much laundry Raymond does (\(R\)):

"First, let's calculate how many packages of 3 flowers Vincent would need if he bought all 18 flowers:

18 flowers / 3 flowers per package = 6 packages

Now, let's find out how much it costs to buy these 6 packages:

6 packages * $2.50 per package = $15.00

Next, let's calculate how many packages of 2 flowers Vincent would need if he bought all 18 flowers:

18 flowers / 2 flowers per package = 9 packages

Now, let's find out how much it costs to buy these 9 packages:

9 packages * $1.00 per package = $9.00

To find out how much money Vincent saves by buying 18 flowers at the better price (package of 3), we subtract the cost of the better deal from the cost of the worse deal:

$15.00 (cost of worst deal) - $9.00 (cost of best deal) = $6.00 savings

So, Vincent saves $6.00 by buying 18 flowers at the better price."
"To find out how much John pays for grooming the dog, we need to calculate the discount on the original price first:

Original Price = $100

Discount Percentage = 30%

Amount of Discount = Original Price * (Discount Percentage / 100)
                  = $100 * (30 / 100)
                  = $100 * 0.30
                  = $30

Now subtract the discount amount from the original price to get the final cost:

Final Cost = Original Price - Amount of Discount
          = $100 - $30
          = $70

So, the final cost for grooming the dog is $70."
"First, we need to determine how much water the two girls each received:

\[
\text{Water per girl} = \frac{1}{6} \times 24 \text{ liters}
\]

Calculating this:

\[
\text{Water per girl} = 4 \text{ liters}
\]

Since both girls get the same amount, together they receive:

\[
\text{Total water for girls} = 4 \text{ liters/girl} \times 2 \text{ girls} = 8 \text{ liters}
\]

Next, we add the water the boy drank:

\[
\text{Boy's water} = 6 \text{ liters}
\]

Now, we calculate the total amount of water used by adding the water consumed by all three:

\[
\text{Total water used} = 8 \text{ liters (girls)} + 6 \text{ liters (boy)} = 14 \text{ liters}
\]

Finally, we subtract the total water used from the original amount to find out how much water was left:

\[
\text{Water left} = 24 \text{ liters (original)} - 14 \text{ liters (used"
"To find out how many stickers Charlie has left, we need to add up all the stickers he received and subtract those he gave away or used:

First, let's calculate the total number of stickers Charlie received initially:
- From the store: 21 stickers
- Birthday gift: 23 stickers

Total received: \( 21 + 23 = 44 \) stickers

Next, let's account for the stickers Charlie gave away and used:
- To his sister: 9 stickers
- Used for decoration: 28 stickers

Total given/used: \( 9 + 28 = 37 \) stickers

Now, subtract the total given/used from the total received to find out how many stickers Charlie has left:
\( 44 - 37 = 7 \)

So, Charlie has 7 stickers left."
"To find out Alex's weight, we first need to calculate four times what Grace weighs:

\[ 4 \times 125 \text{ pounds} = 500 \text{ pounds} \]

Then, since Alex weighs 2 pounds less than this amount:

\[ 500 \text{ pounds} - 2 \text{ pounds} = 498 \text{ pounds} \]

Now that we know both their weights, we add them together to get their combined weight:

\[ 125 \text{ pounds (Grace)} + 498 \text{ pounds (Alex)} = 623 \text{ pounds} \]

So, their combined weight is 623 pounds."
"To find the total number of thorns on all the roses, you need to multiply the number of roses by the number of thorns per rose:

Total thorns = 3 × 8 = 24

So, there are a total of 24 thorns."
"Let's denote the number of games the team won as \( W \) and the number of games they lost as \( L \).

According to the problem:

1. The total number of games played is 22, which gives us our first equation:
\[ W + L = 22 \]

2. The team won 8 more games than they lost, giving us a second equation:
\[ W = L + 8 \]

Now we can solve this system of equations. First, substitute \( L + 8 \) for \( W \) in the first equation:

\[ (L + 8) + L = 22 \]

Simplify by combining like terms:

\[ 2L + 8 = 22 \]

Subtract 8 from both sides:

\[ 2L = 14 \]

Divide both sides by 2:

\[ L = 7 \]

So, the team lost 7 games. Now we can find out how many they won using the second equation:

\[ W = L + 8 \]
\[ W = 7 + 8 \]
\[ W = 15 \]

Therefore, the team won 15 games."
"To determine the total number of quilt blocks Gene has, we need to calculate both the number of vacations he's been on and the number of years it took him to reach age 34 starting from age 23.

First, let's find out how many vacations Gene has been on:

\[ \text{Number of vacations} = 4 \text{ (vacations per year)} \times (\text{Age when he became an adult} - \text{Starting age}) \]
\[ \text{Number of vacations} = 4 \times (34 - 23) \]
\[ \text{Number of vacations} = 4 \times 11 \]
\[ \text{Number of vacations} = 44 \]

Now, to find the total number of quilt blocks, we multiply the number of vacations by the number of years in each vacation period, which is 1 year per vacation:

\[ \text{Total quilt blocks} = \text{Number of vacations} \times \text{Years per vacation} \]
\[ \text{Total quilt blocks} = 44 \times 1 \]
\[ \text{Total quilt blocks} = 44 \]

Therefore, Gene has 44"
"To find out how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to calculate the number of rings for each instance:

1st ringing: 4 times

Second ringing: 3 times longer than the first one, which means \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.

Third ringing: Half as long as the second one, which means \(12 / 2 = 6\) times.

Adding them up gives us the total number of times the alarm rang:

\(4 + 12 + 6 = 22\)

So, the alarm rang 22 times in total today."
"To calculate Sylvie's annual salary after three more years of service, we need to apply the yearly increment of 10% on her current salary for three years. 

Firstly, let's find out her salary before the third increase:

Sylvie's salary before the first increase (in December) was $600.

For each subsequent year, her salary increases by 10%, which means it becomes 110% of the previous year's salary. Therefore, we multiply her current salary by 1.10 for each additional year:

After one year of service: \(600 \times 1.10\)
After two years of service: \(600 \times 1.10^2\)
After three years of service: \(600 \times 1.10^3\)

Now let's calculate this step by step:

\[600 \times 1.10 = 660\]

\[660 \times 1.10 = 726\]

\[726 \times 1.10 = 800.6\]

So, after three more years of service, Sylvie's annual salary would"
"Let's denote the number of copies Harald sold as \( H \). According to the information given:

1. Marilyn's sales = \( 10H \) (since it sold 10 times as many copies as Harald)
2. Combined sales by both = \( H + 10H = 88,000 \)

This simplifies to:
\[ 11H = 88,000 \]

To find out how many copies Harald sold (\( H \)), we divide both sides of the equation by 11:

\[ H = \frac{88,000}{11} \]
\[ H = 8,000 \]

So, Harald sold 8,000 copies of the record."
"To determine how much Christina will spend on gift bags, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of guests who actually attend the party:**
   - Christina invited 16 friends.
   - 1/4 of the attendees don't show up.
   - Therefore, 3/4 of the attendees do show up (since 1 - 1/4 = 3/4).

2. **Determine the number of guests who receive a gift bag:**
   - Since 3/4 of the invited guests show up, the number of guests receiving gifts is \( \frac{3}{4} \times 16 \).
   
\[
\text{Number of guests} = 16 \times \frac{3}{4} = 12
\]

3. **Calculate the total cost of the gift bags:**
   - Each gift bag costs $2.
   - Total cost is the number of guests times the cost per gift bag.

\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 = \$24
\]

Therefore, Christina will spend $24 on gift bags."
"To calculate how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we first need to determine the amount of potato salad one adult dinosaur will consume:

Adults: 20 people × 10 lbs/person = 200 lbs

Next, we'll find out how much potato salad one child will consume. Since a child eats half as much as an adult:

Child consumption = Adult consumption / 2
Child consumption = 10 lbs / 2 = 5 lbs/person

Now, let's calculate the total potato salad needed for all the children:

Children: 5 people × 5 lbs/person = 25 lbs

Finally, we add up the amounts for both adults and children to get the total amount of potato salad required:

Total potato salad needed = Adult consumption + Child consumption
Total potato salad needed = 200 lbs + 25 lbs = 225 lbs

Therefore, Ted needs to bring 225 pounds of potato salad to the picnic to ensure there is enough for everyone."
"To find out the total number of pets Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine how many pets Marcia has. Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, and Cindy has four pets, Marcia has \(4 + 2 = 6\) pets.
   
2. Calculate how many pets Jan has. Jan has three times the number of pets Marcia has, which is \(6 \times 3 = 18\) pets.

3. Add up all their pets to get the total. Cindy has 4 pets, Marcia has 6 pets, and Jan has 18 pets. So the total is \(4 + 6 + 18\).

Let's calculate the sum:

\(4 + 6 + 18 = 28\)

So, the three of them have a total of 28 pets combined."
"Let's denote the ages as follows:

- Let \( J \) represent the age of Jackson,
- \( A \) represent the age of Amy,
- \( C \) represent the age of Corey,
- \( I \) represent the age of James.

We know from the problem statement:

1. Amy is 5 years older than Jackson, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   A = J + 5
   \]

2. Amy is also 2 years younger than Corey, which gives us the equation:
   \[
   A = C - 2
   \]

3. James is 10 years old and one year younger than Corey, giving us the equation:
   \[
   I = C - 1
   \]
   
Since we already know that James is 10, this simplifies our third equation to:
\[
C - 1 = 10
\]

Solving for \( C \):
\[
C = 11

"To find out the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we need to follow these steps:

1. Find out the number of dogs.
2. Use this information to find out the number of cats.
3. Calculate the combined number of dogs and cats.
4. Subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats to get the number of rabbits.
5. Add all the numbers together to get the total number of pets.

Given data:
Number of dogs (D) = 60

Since there are two cats for every dog, the number of cats (C) will be twice the number of dogs:
Number of cats (C) = 2 * Number of dogs (D)
                   = 2 * 60
                   = 120

Now, let's calculate the combined number of dogs and cats:
Combined number of dogs and cats (D+C) = 60 + 120
                                      = 180

Finally, subtract 12 from the combined number of dogs and cats to get the number of rabbits:
Number of rabbits (R) = Combined number of dogs and cats (D+C) - 12

1. Calculate how many hours James slept by finding \( \frac{2}{3} \) of the number of hours Harry slept.
2. Subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept to find the difference.

Let's calculate it step by step:

1. James slept \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 \) hours.
   \( \frac{2}{3} \times 9 = 6 \) hours.

So, James slept 6 hours.

2. To find out how many more hours Harry slept than James, subtract the number of hours James slept from the number of hours Harry slept:
   \( 9 - 6 = 3 \) hours.

Therefore, Harry slept 3 more hours than James."
"To find out how many tomatoes Freda used, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the original volume of the tomatoes before cooking them into sauce.
2. Calculate how many tomatoes were needed based on the original volume.

First, let's determine the original volume of the tomatoes. Since the tomatoes lose half their volume when cooked, the final sauce volume (32 ounces) represents one-quarter of the original volume. Therefore, the original volume was \(32 \times 4 = 128\) ounces.

Next, since each can contains three tomatoes, and the total volume of tomatoes before cooking equals 128 ounces, we can calculate the number of tomatoes by dividing this volume by the volume per can (which is equivalent to the number of tomatoes times the volume of a single tomato):

\[ \text{Number of tomatoes} = \frac{\text{Total volume}}{\text{Volume per can}} = \frac{128}{\frac{128}{3}} = 3 \]

So, Freda used 3 tomatoes for her last batch of tomato sauce."
"To determine how many cars drove through the traffic jam in the first 15 minutes, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the initial number of cars**: Initially, there were 30 cars on the motorway.

2. **Subtract the cars that took an exit**:
   \[
   \text{Initial number of cars} - \text{Number of cars that took an exit} = \text{Remaining cars}
   \]
   Given that 5 cars took an exit:

"To determine how many potted plants Mary will remain with, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial number of potted plants Mary has before receiving any new ones.
   - She already has 2 potted plants on each of the 40 window ledges.
   - Therefore, the initial number of potted plants is \(2 \times 40 = 80\).

2. Add the newly received potted plants to the initial amount.
   - Mary receives 18 new potted plants.
   - Adding these to the initial amount gives us \(80 + 18 = 98\) potted plants.

3. Subtract the number of potted plants she plans to give away.
   - Mary decides to give 1 potted plant from each of the 40 window ledges to friends and family.
   - This amounts to \(1 \times 40 = 40\) potted plants given away.

4. Finally, subtract the number of potted plants given away from the current total.
   - The final number of potted plants Mary will have is \(98 - 40 = 58\).

Therefore, Mary will remain with 58 potted plants."
"To find out how many times the doorbell rang, we need to calculate the number of doorbell rings made by each friend:

First Friend: 20 times

Second Friend: This was 1/4 more than the First Friend, which means it was (1+1/4)*20 = 22.5 times

Third Friend: This was 10 times more than the Fourth Friend, which means it was (1+10)*60 = 160 times

Fourth Friend: We know this was 60 times.

Now add up all these numbers to get the total number of doorbell rings:

Total = First Friend + Second Friend + Third Friend + Fourth Friend
Total = 20 + 22.5 + 160 + 60
Total = 262.5

So, the doorbell made 262.5 doorbell rings. However, since you can't ring half a bell, I'm assuming the problem intends for us to round or consider whole numbers. In real life, if someone rings a doorbell, they typically press the button once, not repeatedly. Therefore, the actual number of doorbell rings would be the sum of the whole numbers"

Pages from Science: 4
Pages from Social Studies: 20
Pages from History: 7
Pages from Geography: 8

Total pages needed: 4 + 20 + 7 + 8 = 39 pages

Solo has already read 15 pages on Monday, so let's subtract those from the total to see how many pages he has left to read before the four remaining days:

Remaining pages: 39 - 15 = 24 pages

Now, we divide this by the number of remaining days (which is 4):

Pages per day needed: 24 ÷ 4 = 6 pages

So, Solo needs to read an average of 6 pages per day over the next four days to finish his reading assignment."
"To determine how many glasses of water John drinks in a week, let's break down his drinking habits:

- Breakfast: 1 glass per meal (total 3 glasses)
- Lunch: 1 glass per meal (total 3 glasses)
- Dinner: 1 glass per meal (total 3 glasses) except on weekends when he has soda instead

Weekdays (Monday through Friday): 
- Breakfast: 3 glasses/day × 5 days/week = 15 glasses
- Lunch: 3 glasses/day × 5 days/week = 15 glasses
- Dinner: 3 glasses/day × 5 days/week = 15 glasses

Weekends:
- Breakfast: 3 glasses/day × 2 days/weekend = 6 glasses
- Lunch: 3 glasses/day × 2 days/weekend = 6 glasses
- Dinner: 1 glass (soda) per meal × 2 meals/night × 2 nights/weekend = 4 glasses

Now we add up all the glasses of water:

Weekday glasses: 15 + 15 + 15 = 45 glasses
Weekend glasses: 6 + 6 + 4 = 16 glasses"
"To find out how long it will take for the fog bank to cover the entire city, we first need to determine how many 3-mile sections make up the entire city distance. 

The city is 42 miles across from one side to the other. To figure out how many 3-mile segments fit into this distance, divide the total length by the segment size:

\[ \text{Number of segments} = \frac{\text{Total distance}}{\text{Segment size}} = \frac{42}{3} = 14 \]

So, there are 14 segments in the city.

Next, since it takes 10 minutes to cover every 3 miles (one segment), multiply the number of segments by the time taken per segment to get the total time required:

\[ \text{Total time} = \text{Number of segments} \times \text{Time per segment} = 14 \times 10 = 140 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, it will take 140 minutes for the fog bank to cover the whole city."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Poppy starts with 1000 pieces.
2. She places a quarter (1/4) of the pieces on the board.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed} = \frac{1}{4} \times 1000 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of pieces remaining is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 1000 - 250 = 750 \text{ pieces}
   \]

3. Her mom then places a third (1/3) of the remaining pieces.
   \[
   \text{Pieces placed by mom} = \frac{1}{3} \times 750 = 250 \text{ pieces}
   \]
   Therefore, the number of pieces remaining after her mom's addition is:
   \[
   \text{Remaining pieces} = 750 - 250 = 500 \text{ pieces}
   \]

So, there are 500 jigsaw pieces left to be placed."
"If Amir eats 5 cookies, Cody eats three times as many, which means:

\[ \text{Cookies Cody eats} = 3 \times 5 = 15 \]

To find out how many cookies they eat together, we add what both of them eat:

\[ \text{Total cookies} = \text{Amir's cookies} + \text{Cody's cookies} \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 5 + 15 \]
\[ \text{Total cookies} = 20 \]

So, together, they eat 20 cookies."
"To find the total inner volume of all three boxes, we first need to calculate the volume of one box without considering the wall thickness, then subtract the effect of the wall thickness on each dimension.

First, let's calculate the volume of one box:

Volume = length × width × height

For one box:
Length = 5 inches
Width = 6 inches
Height = 4 inches

So, the volume of one box (without wall thickness) is:
\[ \text{Volume}_{\text{one box}} = 5 \times 6 \times 4 = 120 \text{ cubic inches} \]

Since the wall thickness is 1 inch, it affects the dimensions of each side by 1 inch. Therefore, we need to subtract this thickness from each dimension:

New length = Original length - 2 (since the thickness affects both sides)
New width = Original width - 2
New height = Original height - 2

New length = \( 5 - 2 = 3 \) inches
New width = \( 6 - 2 = 4 \) inches
New height = \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) inches

Now, let's calculate the new volumes with the reduced"
"To determine how many 30-minute episodes Frankie watched on Wednesday, we need to break down the time spent watching TV across the weekdays:

1. **Monday and Tuesday**: Frank watched 1 hour (60 minutes) per evening. Since it's two nights, that totals 120 minutes or 2 hours.
2. **Thursday**: Frank watched one 1-hour episode and one 30-minute episode. The combined duration is 1 hour + 30 minutes = 130 minutes or 2 hours and 10 minutes.
3. **Friday**: Frank watched two 1-hour episodes. This totals 2 hours.
4. **Wednesday**: We know the total time spent watching TV was 7 hours. We subtract the time already accounted for from this total to find out how long he watched on Wednesday. 

First, let's add up the time he spent watching TV during the other days:
\[ \text{Total time} = 2 \text{ hours (Mon/Wed)} + 2 \text{ hours (Thur/Fri)} = 4 \text{ hours} \]

Now, subtract this from the overall total time:

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year as \( x \). According to the problem, he made twice as many this time around:

\[ 2x \]

He then realized he had baked 15 more than he intended, which gives us:

\[ 2x + 15 \]

When he dropped 5 cookies, he was left with 110:

\[ (2x + 15) - 5 = 110 \]

Solving this equation step by step:

\[ 2x + 15 - 5 = 110 \]
\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]
\[ 2x = 100 \]
\[ x = 50 \]

So, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year."
"To determine the total amount spent by the person on gas after receiving cashback, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial cost without any cashback.
2. Determine the cashback received.
3. Subtract the cashback from the initial cost to get the final amount paid.

Let's go through each step in detail:

1. **Calculate the initial cost without any cashback**:
   The price of gas is $3.00 per gallon, and the person buys 10 gallons.
   \[
   \text{Initial Cost} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$3.00/\text{gallon} = \$30.00
   \]

2. **Determine the cashback received**:
   The app company offers $0.20 cashback per gallon.
   \[
   \text{Cashback per Gallon} = 10 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.20/\text{gallon} = \$2.00
   \]
   Since the cashback applies to all 10 gallons purchased, the total cashback is:
   \[
   \text{Total Cashback} = 10 \text{"
"To determine the average number of fruit roll-ups eaten by Marcell and Beatrice, we need to calculate the total number of roll-ups each person consumed and then find the average.

First, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate:

Beatrice's roll-up width is 2 units, and her length is 24 units. Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Beatrice ate is:
\[ \text{Total roll-ups by Beatrice} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 2 \times 24 = 48 \]

Next, let's calculate the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate:

Marcell's roll-up width is 3 units, and his length is 14 units. Therefore, the total number of roll-ups Marcell ate is:
\[ \text{Total roll-ups by Marcell} = \text{width} \times \text{length} = 3 \times 14 = 42 \]

Now, we add the total number of roll-ups eaten by both Marcell and Beatrice to get the combined total:
\[ \text{Combined total roll-ups} = \text{Total roll-ups by Beatrice} + \text{"
"First, let's find out how fast Julia rows her boat. We know it takes her 16 seconds to row 20 feet, so:

\[ \text{Speed} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Time}} = \frac{20 \text{ ft}}{16 \text{ sec}} = 1.25 \text{ ft/sec} \]

Now we need to calculate how long it will take her to reach the shore. Since the distance to the shore is 64 seconds, we divide this by her speed:

\[ \text{Time to reach shore} = \frac{64 \text{ sec}}{1.25 \text{ ft/sec}} = 51.2 \text{ sec} \]

Since the boat is leaking water at a rate of 2 liters per 10 feet, we need to convert the rowing distance into feet:

\[ 20 \text{ ft} \times \left(\frac{30 \text{ ft}}{1 \text{ m}}\right) \times \left(\frac{1 \text{ m}}{100 \text{ cm}}\right) \times \left(\frac"
"To determine how many times the whiteboard is cleaned in a day, we need to consider both the number of teachers and their usage pattern.

Given:

1. There are 4 teachers sharing the whiteboard.
2. Each teacher takes 2 lessons per day.
3. The whiteboard is cleaned 3 times during each lesson.

Let's calculate the total cleaning frequency step by step:

1. **Total number of lessons per day**: 
   Since each of the 4 teachers has 2 lessons per day,
   \[
   4 \text{ teachers} \times 2 \text{ lessons/teacher/day} = 8 \text{ lessons/day}
   \]

2. **Cleaning frequency per lesson**:
   Each lesson requires 3 cleanings.

3. **Total cleaning frequency per day**:
   Multiply the number of lessons by the number of cleanings per lesson:
   \[
   8 \text{ lessons/day} \times 3 \text{ cleanings/lesson} = 24 \text{ cleanings/day}
   \]

Therefore, the whiteboard is cleaned 24 times per day."
"To find out how many flowers Ryan has after 15 days, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of flowers planted by multiplying the number of flowers Ryan plants per day by the number of days. 
   \( \text{Total flowers planted} = 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} \)

2. Add the number of flowers that did not grow to the total number of flowers planted.

Let's calculate this step-by-step:

1. Total flowers planted:
   \( 2 \text{ flowers/day} \times 15 \text{ days} = 30 \text{ flowers} \)

2. Flowers that did not grow:

"To determine how many ducks can be seen in Jamal's photograph, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the capacity of Jamal's phone:**
   - Jamal's phone can hold 1800 photographs.

2. **Calculate the capacity of Brittany's phone:**
   - Brittany's phone can hold 50 times more photographs than Jamal's phone.
   \[
   \text{Capacity of Brittany's phone} = 50 \times \text{Capacity of Jamal's phone}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Capacity of Brittany's phone} = 50 \times 1800 = 90000 \text{ photographs}
   \]

3. **Find out how many photos Jamal took in his photograph of the ducks:**
   - Since Jamal's photograph contains 1800 photographs, this must be the number of ducks visible in the photograph.
   
Therefore, the number of ducks that can be seen in Jamal's photograph of the ducks at the zoo is:

"First, let's calculate the initial cost of the lumber Sasha bought:

For the ten 2x4x10 boards:
\( \text{Cost per board} = \$10 \)
\( \text{Number of boards} = 10 \)
\( \text{Total cost for these boards} = \$10 \times 10 = \$100 \)

For the five 4x4x10 boards:
\( \text{Cost per board} = \$16 \)
\( \text{Number of boards} = 5 \)
\( \text{Total cost for these boards} = \$16 \times 5 = \$80 \)

Now, let's add both totals to find the overall cost:
\( \text{Total cost} = \$100 + \$80 = \$180 \)

Next, we'll determine the new price of the lumber since it has increased by 50%. To find this, we multiply the original price by 1.5 (which represents a 50% increase):
\( \text{New price per board} = \$16 \times 1.5 = \$24 \)

"To find out how many teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we need to understand the given ratio and apply it to the total amount of sugar used.

The ratio of sugar to water is given as 7:13. This means that for every 7 teaspoons of sugar, she uses 13 cups of water. We know that the total amount of sugar and water combined is 120 teaspoons (teaspoons of sugar + cups of water).

Let's denote the amount of sugar by \( S \) and the amount of water by \( W \). According to the ratio:

\[ S : W = 7 : 13 \]

This implies that for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. Therefore, if \( S \) represents the quantity of sugar, then \( W \) would represent \( \frac{13}{7}S \), because the relationship between sugar and water must remain consistent throughout the problem.

Given that the total amount of sugar and water together is 120 teaspoons, we can write the equation:

\[ S + \frac{13}{7}S = 120 \]

Combining like terms on the left side gives us:

"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we know that there were initially 2 containers of imported vehicles, each containing 5 vehicles. This gives us a total of \(2 \times 5 = 10\) vehicles.

2. We also know that the total number of vehicles at the port on the second day was 30.

3. To find out how many additional vehicles were added on the second day, we subtract the initial number of vehicles (10) from the total number of vehicles (30). 

   Therefore, \(30 - 10 = 20\).

4. Since each container holds exactly 5 vehicles, we divide the number of additional vehicles (20) by the number of vehicles per container (5) to find out how many containers were imported on the second day.

   Hence, \(20 \div 5 = 4\).

So, 4 containers were imported on the second day."
"Let's start by calculating Adrien's original salary. We know that his salary was 30% higher than Lylah's, and we also know that his current salary is 40% higher than it was four years ago. 

Let \(L\) represent Lylah's original salary. According to the problem:

\[ \text{Adrien's original salary} = L + 0.3L = 1.3L \]

We are told that Adrien's current salary is 40% higher than his original salary, which is given as $40,000. Therefore:

\[ \text{Current Salary} = L + 0.4(L) = 1.4L \]
\[ 1.4L = \$40,000 \]

Now let's solve for \(L\):

\[ L = \frac{\$40,000}{1.4} \]
\[ L = \$28,571.43 \]

(We'll round this value to a reasonable number of decimal places.)

Next, let's find out Adrien's current salary based on Lylah's salary:

\[ \text{Adrien's Current Salary} = "
"To determine how many sheets of paper Miguel uses every month, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sheets used per week:**
   - Miguel uses 2 pads of paper per week.
   - Each pad contains 30 sheets of paper.
   \[
   \text{Sheets used per week} = 2 \text{ pads/week} \times 30 \text{ sheets/pad}
   \]
   \[
   \text{Sheets used per week} = 60 \text{ sheets/week}
   \]

2. **Convert weeks into months:**
   - Typically, one month consists of about 4 weeks (though this can vary depending on the specific month).

3. **Calculate the number of sheets used per month:**
   - Multiply the weekly usage by the number of weeks in a month.
   \[
   \text{Sheets used per month} = 60 \text{ sheets/week} \times 4 \text{ weeks/month}

Therefore, Miguel uses 240 sheets of paper"
"To find out the total number of fruits Morisette and Kael brought, we need to calculate the number of fruits each person brought separately and then add them together.

First, let's determine how many fruits Kael brought:

Kael brought twice the amount of apples as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 5 apples, Kael brought \( 2 \times 5 = 10 \) apples.

Kael also brought half the number of oranges as Morisette. Since Morisette brought 8 oranges, Kael brought \( \frac{1}{2} \times 8 = 4 \) oranges.

Now, let's calculate the total number of fruits each person brought:

For Morisette:
\( 5 \) (apples) + \( 8 \) (oranges) = \( 13 \) fruits

For Kael:
\( 10 \) (apples) + \( 4 \) (oranges) = \( 14 \) fruits

Finally, we'll add the total number of fruits brought by both:

\( 13 \) (Morisette's fruits) + \( 14 \) (Kael's fruits) = \( 27"
"To calculate Sadie's total sleep over the entire week, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Monday:** 
   Sadie sleeps 8 hours.

2. **Tuesday and Wednesday (next two days):**
   She sleeps 2 hours less than Monday each day. Therefore:
   Tuesday: \( 8 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \)
   Wednesday: \( 8 \text{ hours} - 2 \text{ hours} = 6 \text{ hours} \)

3. **Thursday through Sunday:**
   The remaining days of the week (Thursday, Friday, Saturday, and Sunday) she sleeps 1 hour more than what she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined. First, we find out how many hours she slept on Tuesday and Wednesday combined:
   \( 6 \text{ hours} + 6 \text{ hours} = 12 \text{ hours} \)
   
   Now, adding 1 hour more to this amount gives us the number of hours she slept during Thursday through Sunday:
   \( 12 \text{ hours} + 1 \text{ hour} = 13 \text{ hours}"
"To determine how many miles Rosie can run in 7 hours, we need to break down her running into segments based on the given speeds.

Firstly, let's calculate the distance Rosie covers during her initial period:

1. Her speed initially is 10 miles per hour (mph).
2. The time spent running at this speed is 3 hours.

Distance covered initially:
\[ \text{Distance} = \text{Speed} \times \text{Time} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_\text{initial} = 10 \, \text{mph} \times 3 \, \text{hours} \]
\[ \text{Distance}_\text{initial} = 30 \, \text{miles} \]

Next, we consider the second part where her speed increases to 5 mph.

Now, we need to find out how long it takes for her to cover these additional 30 miles at a rate of 5 mph:

\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
\[ \text{Time}_\text{second} = \frac{30 \, \text{miles}}{5 \, \text{mph"
"Let's denote the number of letters initially in the stamping pile as \( x \). According to the problem, Jennie stamps one-third of these letters, which amounts to \( \frac{x}{3} \) letters. These stamped letters then go into the other pile (the pile of already-stamped letters), increasing its size by \( \frac{x}{3} \).

We know that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. This means:

\[ \frac{x}{3} = 30 \]

To find \( x \), we multiply both sides of this equation by 3:

\[ x = 30 \times 3 \]
\[ x = 90 \]

So, there were 90 letters initially in the pile of letters needing stamps before any were stamped."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial number of spoons**: Julia initially had no spoons since she was out of them.
2. **Spoons given by her husband**: Her husband bought a package of 5 new spoons and gave them to her. This increases her total to \(0 + 5 = 5\) spoons.
3. **Spoons used by Julia**: During the preparation of the stew, she used 3 spoons to taste it. This decreases her total to \(5 - 3 = 2\) spoons.
4. **Spoons remaining on the table**: When setting the table, she had 12 spoons left. This gives us the equation: \(2 + x = 12\), where \(x\) represents the number of additional spoons she received or had before starting to use them up until the last count.

To find \(x\):
\[ 2 + x = 12 \]
Subtract 2 from both sides:
\[ x = 12 - 2 \]
\[ x = 10 \]

So, the package that Julia bought contained 10 spoons."
"To find out how many sausages Dylan bought in all, we need to add up both types of sausages he purchased.

First, let's calculate the number of fish sausages:

He bought 6 more fish sausages than chicken sausages. Since he bought 38 chicken sausages, we add 6 to this amount:

Fish sausages = Chicken sausages + 6
Fish sausages = 38 + 6
Fish sausages = 44

Now, let's add the number of chicken sausages and fish sausages together:

Total sausages = Chicken sausages + Fish sausages
Total sausages = 38 + 44
Total sausages = 82

So, Dylan bought 82 sausages in all."
"To find out how many friends Amy and Lily have together, we need to first determine how many friends Amy has based on the information given.

Lily made 50 friends. According to the problem, Amy made 20 more friends than Lily. Therefore:

Amy's number of friends = Lily's number of friends + 20
Amy's number of friends = 50 + 20
Amy's number of friends = 70

Now, to find the total number of friends both Amy and Lily have together, we add their numbers of friends:

Total friends = Amy's friends + Lily's friends
Total friends = 70 + 50
Total friends = 120

So, Amy and Lily have a total of 120 friends together."
"To calculate the total amount of money Dillon will spend on buying 4 watermelons, 20 peppers, and 10 oranges, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the cost of one watermelon based on the price of one pepper.
   - Given that an orange costs 5 less than a watermelon and each pepper costs $15,
     then an orange costs \(15 - 5 = $10\).

2. Calculate the cost of four watermelons.
   - Since a watermelon costs three times as much as a pepper,
     a watermelon costs \(3 \times $15 = $45\).
   - Therefore, four watermelons would cost \(4 \times $45 = $180\).

3. Calculate the cost of twenty peppers.
   - As given, each pepper costs $15.
   - Thus, twenty peppers would cost \(20 \times $15 = $300\).

4. Calculate the cost of ten oranges.
   - We know an orange costs $10.
   - Hence, ten oranges would cost \(10 \times $10 = $100\).

Finally, sum up all the expenses:
-"
"To calculate the hospital's profit from these visits, we need to determine both the revenue generated by charging patients and the expenses incurred by the hospital.

Revenue per visit:

Each patient spends 24 minutes seeing their doctor. Since the doctors charge $150 per hour, the hourly rate for one doctor is $150 / 60 minutes = $2.50 per minute. 

So, the revenue per visit is 24 minutes * $2.50/minute = $60.

Since there are 500 people visiting the hospital daily, the total daily revenue is 500 visits * $60/visit = $30,000.

Expenses:

The hospital also incurs costs related to running its operations, such as salaries, rent, utilities, etc., which are not directly mentioned in this scenario. However, since the question focuses on profit calculation based on the given data (which includes patient visits), we will assume no other direct operational costs are involved here.

Therefore, the hospital's profit would be equal to its total daily revenue, which is $30,000."
"To find out how many elves Nissa has left, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. Initially, there are 60 elves.

2. A third of the elves quit after children vomit on them. This would mean \( \frac{1}{3} \times 60 = 20 \) elves quit.

   Therefore, the number of elves left after vomiting is \( 60 - 20 = 40 \).

3. Then, 10 of the remaining elves quit after kids kick their shins. 

   So, we subtract those 10 from the remaining 40 elves.

   The final count of elves left is \( 40 - 10 = 30 \).

Therefore, Nissa has 30 elves left in her department store's Santa village."
"To find out how much Joseph spent over May and June combined, you need to calculate his expenditures for both months and then add them together.

For May, Joseph's expenditure was $500.

For June, his expenditure was $60 less than what he spent in May, which means:

$500 (May) - $60 = $440 (June)

Now, add the expenditures for both months to get the total:

$500 (May) + $440 (June) = $940

So, Joseph's total expenditure for May and June was $940."
"To find out how many tickets Pam and Fred used that day, we need to calculate the number of rides each of them took and then multiply by the ticket price per ride.

For Pam:
- She rode the roller coaster 2 times.
- She also rode the luge 2 times.
So, the total number of rides Pam took is \(2 + 2 = 4\) rides.

For Fred:
- He rode the roller coaster 4 times (since he rode it 4 times).
- He also rode the luge 2 times.
So, the total number of rides Fred took is \(4 + 2 = 6\) rides.

Now, since each ride costs 6 tickets, we multiply the total number of rides by the ticket price:

- For Pam: \(4 \times 6 = 24\) tickets.
- For Fred: \(6 \times 6 = 36\) tickets.

Therefore, together they used \(24 + 36 = 60\) tickets that day."
"To find out how many miles Walt walked on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of miles Walt walked on Tuesday**: 
   Since he walked 6 times as many miles on Tuesday as he did on Monday, and he walked 4 miles on Monday, then he walked \(6 \times 4 = 24\) miles on Tuesday.

2. **Add up the total miles walked from Monday to Tuesday**:
   The total distance from Monday to Tuesday is \(4 + 24 = 28\) miles.

3. **Determine the distance walked on Wednesday**:
   We know the total distance from Monday to Wednesday is 41 miles. Therefore, the distance walked on Wednesday would be \(41 - 28 = 13\) miles.

So, Walt walked 13 miles on Wednesday."
"To find out how much Tom pays in a year for car washes, we first need to calculate how many car washes he receives in a year.

He gets 4 car washes per month, and there are 12 months in a year:

\[ \text{Annual Car Washes} = 4 \text{ (per month)} \times 12 \text{ (months/year)} \]

\[ \text{Annual Car Washes} = 48 \]

Now, if each car wash costs $15, then we multiply this by the number of car washes he gets in a year:

\[ \text{Total Cost} = 48 \text{ (car washes/year)} \times \$15/\text{car wash} \]

\[ \text{Total Cost} = \$720 \]

So, Tom pays $720 in a year for car washes."
"To determine how many video games Bobby has, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Find out how many video games Brian actually has:**
   - Initially, Brian had 20 video games.
   - However, Brian lost 5 video games.
   - Therefore, Brian now has \( 20 - 5 = 15 \) video games.

2. **Calculate how many video games Bobby has based on Brian's count:**
   - According to the problem, Bobby has ""5 fewer than 3 times as many video games"" as Brian.
   - First, calculate three times the number of Brian's remaining video games: 
     \[
     3 \times 15 = 45
     \]
   - Since Bobby has 5 fewer than this amount, subtract 5 from 45:
     \[
     45 - 5 = 40
     \]

So, Bobby has 40 video games."
"To find out how many female Scottish unicorns there are, we first need to determine how many unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands. 

Given that one-third of all the unicorns are in the Scottish Highlands, we calculate this number as follows:

\[
\text{Number of unicorns in Scotland} = \frac{1}{3} \times 27
\]

Performing the calculation gives us:

\[
\text{Number of unicorns in Scotland} = 9
\]

Now, since two-thirds of these unicorns are female, we calculate the number of female Scottish unicorns by taking two-thirds of the 9 unicorns:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = \frac{2}{3} \times 9
\]

Calculating this gives us:

\[
\text{Number of female Scottish unicorns} = 6
\]

Therefore, there are 6 female Scottish unicorns in the park."

"To find out how many questions Mark left incomplete, we need to calculate the number of questions he could have answered within the given time limits and subtract this from the total number of questions on both tests.

First Test:
- Total questions: 75
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 8 hours

Number of questions he could have answered in the first test:
\( \frac{75}{5} \times 8 = 15 \times 8 = 120 \) questions

Second Test:
- Total questions: 100
- Rate: 5 questions per hour
- Time available: 6 hours

Number of questions he could have answered in the second test:
\( \frac{100}{5} \times 6 = 20 \times 6 = 120 \) questions

Now, let's add up all the questions he attempted:
\( 120 + 120 = 240 \) questions

Since Mark had 75 questions to begin with, we subtract the total number of questions he attempted from the total number of questions:

\( 75 + 75 = 150 \)

"Let's denote the number of blue gumballs by \( B \) and the number of pink gumballs by \( P \).

According to the problem statement, we know:

\[ B = 12 \]

It also states that the number of pink gumballs is 22 more than four times the number of blue gumballs. Therefore,

\[ P = 4B + 22 \]

Substituting the value of \( B \):

\[ P = 4(12) + 22 \]
\[ P = 48 + 22 \]
\[ P = 70 \]

So, there are 70 pink gumballs in the candy machine."
"To find the percentage of semi-automatic cars among the total number of cars available for rental:

1. **Determine the number of semi-automatic cars**: 
   The problem states that there are 4 manual cars out of a total of 20 cars. Therefore, the number of semi-automatic cars is \( 20 - (12 \text{ automatic} + 4 \text{ manual}) \).
   
   \[
   \text{Number of semi-automatic cars} = 20 - (12 + 4) = 20 - 16 = 4
   \]

2. **Calculate the percentage**:
   To get the percentage of semi-automatic cars, divide the number of semi-automatic cars by the total number of cars and then multiply by 100.

   \[
   \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{\text{Number of semi-automatic cars}}{\text{Total number of cars}} \right) \times 100

   Substituting the values we have:
   
   \[
   \text{Percentage of semi-automatic cars} = \left( \frac{4}{20} \right) \times "
"Let's denote the number of queen bees by \( q \). According to the problem, there are twice as many baby bees as queens, so we'll denote the number of baby bees by \( 2q \).

Next, since there are twice as many worker bees as baby bees, the number of worker bees will be \( 2 \times (2q) = 4q \).

We know the total number of bees is 700. Therefore, we can write the equation:

\[ q + 2q + 4q = 700 \]

Combining like terms gives us:

\[ 7q = 700 \]

To find \( q \), divide both sides by 7:

\[ q = \frac{700}{7} \]
\[ q = 100 \]

Now that we have the value of \( q \), which represents the number of queens, we can calculate the number of worker bees using the formula \( 4q \):

\[ 4q = 4 \times 100 \]
\[ 4q = 400 \]

So, there are 400 worker bees in the hive."
"To determine how much money Jordan would earn in one week by spending his video game time working instead, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of hours Jordan spends playing video games per day.
2. Multiply that number by the hourly wage to find out how much he earns from playing video games.
3. Multiply the daily earnings by the number of days in a week (7) to get the weekly earnings.

Let's go through it step by step:

1. Jordan plays video games for 2 hours every day.
2. His part-time job pays him $10 per hour. Therefore, his daily earnings from playing video games are \( 2 \text{ hours/day} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$20/\text{day} \).
3. To find out how much he earns in a week, we multiply his daily earnings by 7 (the number of days in a week):

\[ \$20/\text{day} \times 7 \text{ days/week} = \$140/\text{week} \]

So, Jordan would earn $140 in one week if he spent his video game time working instead."

\[ \text{Total pineapples} = 10 \text{ hectares} \times 100 \text{ pineapples/ha} = 1000 \text{ pineapples} \]

Next, since John harvests his pineapples every 3 months, we need to determine how many such periods fit into a year:
\[ \text{Number of harvests in a year} = \frac{12 \text{ months}}{3 \text{ months/harvest}} = 4 \text{ harvests/year} \]

Finally, multiply the number of harvests by"
"To find out how many Lego pieces Johnny picks up, we need to calculate the total number of pieces in each box and then sum them up.

1. First box: It contains 500 pieces.
2. Second box: This box has 3 times as many pieces as the first one. Therefore, it contains \(500 \times 3 = 1500\) pieces.
3. Third box: This box has \(\frac{1}{4}\) the number of pieces as the second one. Thus, it contains \(1500 \div 4 = 375\) pieces.

Now, let's add these numbers together:

\[ 500 (first\ box) + 1500 (second\ box) + 375 (third\ box) = 2375 \]

So, Johnny picks up 2375 Lego pieces in total."
"To find out how many bees Debra saw return to the hive in the last 6 hours, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. First, we know that 30 bees left the hive in the first 6 hours.
   
2. In the next 6 hours, half that number (which would be 30 / 2) came back. This gives us:
   \[
   \frac{30}{2} = 15 \text{ bees}
   \]

3. Two times as many bees as initially left the hive flew back. Since 30 bees initially left, this number is:
   \[
   2 \times 30 = 60 \text{ bees}
   \]

4. Next, we need to account for the fact that all 30 bees that left during the first 6 hours didn’t return yet. These remaining bees will now return to the hive. Therefore, the total number of bees returning to the hive in the last 6 hours is the sum of those that came back within the next 6 hours plus the ones that hadn't returned yet:

"First, let's calculate the time it takes for Steve to reach his destination:

Time (Steve) = Distance / Speed
            = 3 miles / 440 feet per minute

Since we need to convert miles into feet for consistency, remember that 1 mile equals 5280 feet.

Time (Steve) = 3 miles × 5280 feet/mile / 440 feet/minute
            = 15840 feet / 440 feet/minute
            ≈ 36 minutes

Now, let's calculate the time it takes for Tim to reach his destination:

Time (Tim) = Distance / Speed
           = 2 miles / 264 feet per minute

Again, converting miles to feet:

Time (Tim) = 2 miles × 5280 feet/mile / 264 feet/minute
           = 10560 feet / 264 feet/minute
           ≈ 40 minutes

So, Steve takes approximately 36 minutes to reach his house, while Tim takes approximately 40 minutes.

Therefore, the winner (Steve) will be waiting at his house for 40 - 3"

"Let's work through this step by step:

1. Let \( x \) represent the number of fries in the original pack.

2. Dave ate 14 fries, so we subtract these from \( x \):
   \[
   x - 14
   \]

3. The seagull stole half of what Dave ate:
   \[
   \frac{1}{2} (x - 14)
   \]

4. Three pigeons ate three fries each:
   \[
   3 \times 3 = 9
   \]

5. A raccoon then stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = (x - 14) - \left( \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) + 9 \right)
   \]
   Simplifying,
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) - 9

   Since the raccoon took two-thirds, the remaining fries would be one-third:
   \[
   \text{Remaining fries} = \frac{1}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}(x -"
"First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Monday, Wednesday, and Friday:

- Three 1-hour classes per day x 3 days (Monday, Wednesday, Friday) = 9 hours

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends on Tuesday and Thursday:

- Two 2-hour classes per day x 2 days (Tuesday, Thursday) = 4 hours

Now, we add the hours spent on both weekdays together:

- 9 hours (weekdays) + 4 hours (weekend days) = 13 hours

Kimo attends class every week for 16 weeks, so to find out the total number of hours he spends on classes during a semester, multiply the weekly hours by the number of weeks:

Therefore, Kimo spends 208 hours attending classes during one semester."
"First, let's convert the lengths of each type of baked good into feet:

- Rolls: Since each roll is 4 inches long, we need to divide this by 12 (since there are 12 inches in a foot) to get the length in feet. This gives us \( \frac{4}{12} = \frac{1}{3} \) feet per roll.
- Croissants: Each croissant is 6 inches long, which converts to \( \frac{6}{12} = \frac{1}{2} \) feet.
- Baguettes: Each baguette is two feet long.

Next, let's calculate the total length contributed by each type of baked good:

- Rolls: With 300 rolls, the total length would be \( 300 \times \frac{1}{3} = 100 \) feet.
- Chocolate croissants: With 120 croissants, the total length would be \( 120 \times \frac{1}{2} = 60 \) feet.
- Baguettes: With 60 baguettes, the total length would be \( 60 \times 2"
"To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to feed all the apes for 2 months, we first calculate the total number of bananas required per month:

- Monkeys: 200 bananas/month
- Gorillas: 400 bananas/month
- Baboons: 100 bananas/month

Total monthly requirement = 200 (monkeys) + 400 (gorillas) + 100 (baboons)
= 700 bananas/month

Now, since we want to know how many bananas are needed for 2 months, we multiply the total monthly requirement by 2:

Bananas needed for 2 months = Total monthly requirement × 2
= 700 bananas/month × 2
= 1400 bananas

So, the zookeeper needs to order 1400 bananas to last for 2 months."
"To determine how far each person ran, we need to calculate their distances step by step.

Firstly, let's find out how far Blake runs:

1. Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
2. The length of one back-and-forth trip (back to the starting point and forward) is half the length of the football field, which is \( \frac{100}{2} = 50 \) yards.
3. Therefore, the distance for one round trip is \( 50 \times 2 = 100 \) yards.
4. Since Blake runs 15 such trips, the total distance he covers is \( 15 \times 100 = 1500 \) yards.

Now, let's find out how far Kelly runs:

1. Kelly runs back and forth 34 times initially, covering \( 34 \times 100 = 3400 \) yards.
2. However, Kelly then runs towards the 40-yard line and back, adding another 40 yards per trip because the running direction changes.
3. This adds an extra \( 40 \times 34 = 1360 \) yards"
"To find out how much Raphael spent on all the items, we need to calculate the cost of each item separately and then add them together:

Cost of pens: 
Each pen costs $1.5, and he bought 4 pens.
So, total cost of pens = 4 pens × $1.5/pen = $6

Cost of notebooks: 
Each notebook costs $4, and he bought 2 notebooks.
So, total cost of notebooks = 2 notebooks × $4/notebook = $8

Cost of bond paper: 
It costs $20 as mentioned.

Now, let's add up the total cost of all these items:
Total amount spent = Cost of pens + Cost of notebooks + Cost of bond paper
Total amount spent = $6 + $8 + $20 = $34

Therefore, Raphael spent $34 on all the school supplies."
"To find out how many tadpoles Finn can see in the pond now, we need to add up all the tadpoles he sees:

1. Initially, Finn sees 11 tadpoles.
2. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding.
   11 (initial) + 6 (new ones) = 17 tadpoles.
3. Next, 2 tadpoles go back into hiding under a rock.
   17 (now total) - 2 (that went away) = 15 tadpoles.

So, Finn can see 15 tadpoles in the pond now."
"To find out the tank's water depth on Wednesday, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the depth of water on Tuesday by adding the additional 7 feet to the initial depth of 17 feet.
2. Calculate the depth of water on Wednesday by finding two-thirds of the depth from Tuesday.

Let's start with step 1:

Depth of water on Tuesday = Initial depth + Additional water
                         = 17 feet + 7 feet
                         = 24 feet

Now let's move to step 2:

Depth of water on Wednesday = (Two-thirds) × Depth on Tuesday
                            = (2/3) × 24 feet
                            = 16 feet

So, the tank's water depth on Wednesday is 16 feet."
"To find out how many fish Anakin and Locsin were able to catch, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish caught by both individuals.

For Anakin:
- Starfish: 10
- Sea horses: 6
- Clownfish: 3

For Locsin:
- Starfish: 10 - 5 = 5 (since he caught 5 fewer)
- Sea horses: 6 - 3 = 3 (since he caught 3 fewer)
- Clownfish: 3 + 2 = 5 (since he caught 2 more)

Now, let's add up all the fish:

Anakin's total:
Starfish: 10
Sea horses: 6
Clownfish: 3
Total for Anakin: 10 + 6 + 3 = 19

Locsin's total:
Starfish: 5

"To find out how much a bag of marbles will cost after 36 months given an initial price increase of 20%, we need to calculate the effect of this percentage increase over time.

Firstly, let's establish the formula for compound interest which represents the growth of the price:

\[ \text{Future Value} = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \(P\) is the initial value (cost) of the item,
- \(r\) is the rate of change per period,
- \(n\) is the number of periods.

In our case:
- The initial value \(P\) is $20,
- The rate of change \(r\) is 20% or 0.20,
- The number of periods \(n\) is 36 months divided by 2 months, which equals 18.

Now, plug these values into the formula:

\[ \text{Future Value} = 20 \times (1 + 0.20)^{18} \]

Calculate the term inside the parentheses first:

\[ (1 + 0.20)^{18} = (1.20)^{18} \]

Using a calculator, you'll find that"
"Let's denote the value of an action figure as A and the value of a red car as R. We know that:

A = $5 (since it costs as much as one action figure)

R = $4 (as given)

Now we need to find out the value of the doll. According to the problem statement, the doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car combined:

Doll = 3 * A + R

Substituting the values we found earlier:

Doll = 3 * $5 + $4
     = $15 + $4
     = $19

So, the doll costs $19.

Now let's calculate the total value of all the toys:

Total value = Value of red cars + Value of action figures + Value of doll

We already know the value of the red cars (5) and the doll ($19), and we calculated the value of the action figures ($5).

Total value = 5 + 3 + 19
            = 28

Therefore, all the toys together are worth $28."
"To determine how much more money Jackie would have by hiring an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to consider both the direct cost of hiring the accountant and the loss of potential freelance income due to not being able to work as many hours.

Firstly, let's calculate the total earnings from freelance work without any accounting services:

- Jacke earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
- If she works 3 fewer hours than usual (due to doing taxes), then she loses out on those 3 hours of work.

Let's denote the number of hours she typically works as \( h \). With the extra tax preparation, she will work \( h - 3 \) hours.

Her hourly rate remains constant, so her total earnings before hiring an accountant would be:
\[ E_{\text{no accountant}} = 35 \times (h - 3) \]

Now, let's add up the costs involved when she hires an accountant:

- The cost of hiring an accountant is $90.

Therefore, the net difference between what she would earn without the accountant and with the accountant is:
\[ \Delta E = E_{\text{with accountant}} - E_{\text{without accountant}} \]
\[ \Delta E ="
"To determine how much money Elvira will have left for her clothing, we need to subtract the total cost of all the accessories from her initial budget.

Here's the step-by-step calculation:

1. **Total Cost of Accessories**:
   - Screen, Keyboard, and Mouse: €1090
   - Scanner: €157
   - CD Burner: €74
   - Printer: €102

   Total cost of accessories = €1090 + €157 + €74 + €102

2. Calculate the sum:
   \[
   1090 + 157 = 1247 \\
   1247 + 74 = 1321 \\
   1321 + 102 = 1423

So, the total cost of all the accessories is €1423.

3. Subtract this amount from Elvira's budget:
   \[
   1500 - 1423 = 77

Therefore, Elvira will have €77 left for her clothing."
"To determine how many times Sandra needs to babysit to collect enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans, we first need to calculate the total number of eggs required:

\[
\text{Total eggs needed} = \text{Number of flans} \times \text{Eggs per flan}
\]
\[
\text{Total eggs needed} = 15 \times 3 = 45
\]

Next, we know that Sandra gets 9 eggs from her neighbor each time she babysits. We'll find out how many times she needs to babysit by dividing the total number of eggs needed by the number of eggs she receives per visit:

\[
\text{Number of visits} = \frac{\text{Total eggs needed}}{\text{Eggs per visit}}
\]
\[
\text{Number of visits} = \frac{45}{9} = 5

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit her neighbor 5 times to get enough eggs for 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Seth's current age by \( S \) and Brooke's current age by \( B \).

According to the information given:

1. Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ S = 2B \]

2. In 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Now we can solve this system of equations step by step:

First, let's express \( S \) using the first equation:
\[ S = 2B \]

Next, substitute \( S \) into the second equation:
\[ (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 2B + 2 + B + 2 = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]

Subtract 4 from both sides:
\[ 3B = 24 \]

Divide both sides by 3:
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old.

Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is 16"
"Let's denote the amount of money Ethel has as E and the amount of money Jimmy has as J.

According to the problem, we know that:

E = $8

We also know that Jimmy has $2 more than twice the money Ethel has, which can be expressed as:

J = 2E + $2

Now, let's substitute the value of E into this equation:

J = 2($8) + $2
J = $16 + $2
J = $18

So, Jimmy has $18."
"To calculate the total number of miles Pancho walks in a week, we need to consider both his daily walking routine and his weekend activities:

1. **Weekday Walking:** 
   - There are 5 weekdays (Monday through Friday).
   - Each weekday, Pancho walks 20 miles.
   - Total weekday miles walked: \( 5 \text{ days} \times 20 \text{ miles/day} = 100 \text{ miles} \).

2. **Weekend Walking:**
   - There are 2 weekend days (Saturday and Sunday).
   - Each weekend day, Pancho walks 10 miles.
   - Total weekend miles walked: \( 2 \text{ days} \times 10 \text{ miles/day} = 20 \text{ miles} \).

Now, add the weekday and weekend miles together to find the total weekly distance Pancho walks:

\[ \text{Total Weekly Miles} = \text{Weekday Miles} + \text{Weekend Miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Weekly Miles} = 100 \text{ miles} + 20 \text{ miles} \]
\[ \text{Total Weekly Miles} = 1"
"To find out the total cost of each uniform, we need to calculate the individual costs of the hat, jacket, and pants, then add them together.

1. The cost of the hat is given as $25.
2. The jacket costs three times as much as the hat, so it's \(3 \times \$25\).
3. The pants' cost is the average of the costs of the hat and jacket. To find this, we add the cost of the hat and the cost of the jacket, divide by 2, and round down if necessary (since you can't buy a fraction of a piece of clothing).

Let's calculate:

- Hat: $25
- Jacket: \(3 \times \$25 = \$75\)
- Pants: Average of hat and jacket = \(\frac{\$25 + \$75}{2} = \frac{\$100}{2} = \$50\)

Now, let's sum up all these costs:

Total cost per uniform = Cost of hat + Cost of jacket + Cost of pants

\[ Total = \$25 + \$75 + \$50 \]

\[ Total = \$150 \]

So, each uniform costs a total"
"To find out the total number of legs Jake sees, we need to calculate the legs contributed by each group separately and then add them together.

First, let's calculate the legs from the spiders:

Number of spiders = 80
Legs per spider = 8

Total legs from spiders = Number of spiders × Legs per spider
= 80 × 8
= 640 legs

Next, let's calculate the legs from the insects:

Number of insects = 90
Legs per insect = 6

Total legs from insects = Number of insects × Legs per insect
= 90 × 6
= 540 legs

Lastly, let's calculate the legs from the rare mutant invertebrates:

Number of rare mutant invertebrates = 3
Legs per rare mutant invertebrate = 10

Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates = Number of rare mutant invertebrates × Legs per rare mutant invertebrate
= 3 × 10
= 30 legs

Now, let's add up all the legs:

Total legs = Total legs from spiders + Total legs from insects + Total legs from rare mutant invertebrates
= 640 + 5"
"To find the total age of the four birds, we need to calculate the ages of all the birds step by step:

1. **Sally Forty-two (Sally Four)**: The problem states that Sally Forty-two is the same age as Sally Thirtytwo. Since Sally Thirtytwo is 8 years old, Sally Forty-two is also 8 years old.

2. **Granny Red**: We know that Granny Red is twice as old as Sally Four. Since Sally Four is 8 years old, Granny Red must be \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.

3. **Sally Twenty-eight (Sally Twentyeight)**: This bird's age is given directly in the problem statement as 28 years old.

4. **Sally Three** (the fourth bird): The problem doesn't specify a direct relationship between this bird and any other, but since it mentions ""four"" birds, we assume it could refer to the oldest one or another unspecified bird. However, without additional information about their relationships, we'll focus on the first three birds for simplicity.

Now, let's add up the ages of the three specified birds:
\[ 8 \text{ (Sally Forty-two)} + 16 \text{ ("
"To calculate the amount Jessica pays per month if she wants to pay 50% more than the minimum payments:

For the student loans: 
\( 300 \times 1.50 = \$450 \)

For the credit card:
\( 200 \times 1.50 = \$300 \)

For the mortgage:
\( 500 \times 1.50 = \$750 \)

Now we add these amounts together:
\( 450 + 300 + 750 = \$1,500 \) per month

Since this is monthly, we multiply by 12 months in a year:
\( 1,500 \times 12 = \$18,000 \)

So, Jessica will pay \( \$18,000 \) annually."
"To find out how long it will take Billy to finish prepting all the potatoes, we need to calculate the time required for both peeling and cutting each potato.

For peeling, it takes Billy about a minute and a half per potato. Since there are 60 minutes in an hour, this would equate to 1 hour and 30 minutes (or 1.5 hours).

For cutting, it takes Billy about 5 seconds per potato.

Now, let's add these times together:

1 hour and 30 minutes (peeling) + 5 seconds (cutting)

Since 1 hour is equal to 3600 seconds (60 minutes * 60 seconds), we can convert the peeling time into seconds as well:

1.5 hours = 1.5 * 3600 seconds = 5400 seconds

So, the total time to prep all the potatoes is:

5400 seconds (for peeling) + 5 seconds (for cutting) = 5405 seconds

Therefore, it will take Billy approximately 5405 seconds or 80 minutes and 45 seconds to finish preparing all the potatoes."
"To find out how much Juan and Carlos spent on lemons, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate Total Revenue**: 
   - They sold 20 glasses per gallon.
   - Each glass was sold for $0.50.
   - Therefore, total revenue \( R \) is calculated as follows:
     \[
     R = 20 \text{ gallons} \times \$0.50/\text{glass} = \$10
     \]

2. **Determine Total Cost**:
   - Let's denote the total cost (lemons and sugar) by \( C \).
   - Profit is defined as Total Revenue minus Total Cost. Given that their total profit is $25, we write:
     \[
     \text{Profit} = R - C
     \]
   - Substituting the known values:
     \[
     \$25 = \$10 - C
     \]

3. **Solve for Total Cost**:
   - Rearrange the equation to solve for \( C \):
     \[
     C = \$10 - \$25

So, they spent $"
"There were 240 - 80 = 160 Chinese people in the race. Since there were 60 boys out of the 160, then there must have been 160 - 60 = 100 girls. Therefore, there were 100 girls on the Chinese team."
"Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Calculate Rent Expense**:
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{4} \) of his salary on rent.
   Salary = $6000
   Rent expense = \( \frac{1}{4} \times 6000 = \$1500 \)

2. **Calculate Car Fuel Expense**:
   Zaid spends \( \frac{1}{3} \) of his salary on car fuel.
   Car fuel expense = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 6000 = \$2000 \)

3. **Calculate Remaining Amount Before Donation**:
   Total initial expenditure (rent + car fuel) = $1500 + $2000 = $3500

   Initial salary = $6000
   Remaining amount before donation = Initial salary - Total expenditure = $6000 - $3500 = $2500

4. **Calculate Donated Amount to Charity**:
   Zaid donates half of the remaining amount to his favorite charity.
   Donated amount to charity = \( \frac{1}{2} \times 2"
"First, let's determine how many crabs Monica has:

Monica has 4 fewer crabs than Bo, which has 40 crabs. Therefore, Monica has:

\( \text{Monica's crabs} = \text{Bo's crabs} - 4 \)
\( \text{Monica's crabs} = 40 - 4 \)
\( \text{Monica's crabs} = 36 \)

Next, we'll find out how many crabs Rani has. Rani has 10 more crabs than Monica:

\( \text{Rani's crabs} = \text{Monica's crabs} + 10 \)
\( \text{Rani's crabs} = 36 + 10 \)
\( \text{Rani's crabs} = 46 \)

Now, let's add up all the crabs to get the total:

Total crabs = \( \text{Bo's crabs} + \text{Monica's crabs} + \text{Rani's crabs} \)
Total crabs = \( 40 + 36 + 46 \)
Total crabs = \("
"To calculate Lloyd's earnings over the first two weeks, we need to add up the number of hours he worked in both weeks and then multiply by his hourly rate.

For the first week, he worked 5 hours.
For the second week, he worked 8 hours.

Total hours worked = Hours in the first week + Hours in the second week
Total hours worked = 5 + 8
Total hours worked = 13

Now, we'll calculate his earnings:

Earnings = Total hours worked × Hourly rate
Earnings = 13 × $10/hour
Earnings = $130

So, Lloyd earned $130 for the first two weeks."

"To determine how many red roses Fred needs to deliver, we first need to find out the quantities of white carnations and red roses based on the information given about pink calla lilies.

1. **Pink Calla Lilies (PCL):**
   - Number of PCL = 200

2. **White Carnations (WC):**
   - PCL = 5 × WC
   - Therefore, WC = PCL / 5 = 200 / 5 = 40

3. **Red Roses (RR):**
   - RR = 4 × WC
   - Therefore, RR = 4 × 40 = 160

Fred needs to deliver all 160 red roses by 5 pm to prevent Sandra from switching suppliers. 

**Final Answer:** Fred must deliver 160 red roses by 5 pm to avoid losing Sandra's business."
"Let's start by defining variables:

- Let \( J \) represent Jean's current age.
- Let \( M \) represent Mark's current age.
- Let \( A \) represent Jan's current age.

From the problem statement, we know:
1. Jean is two years older than Mark:
\[ J = M + 2 \]

2. Two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age:
Two years ago, Mark's age was \( M - 2 \), and half of Jan's age was \( \frac{A}{2} \). Thus,
\[ M - 2 = \frac{A}{2} + 5 \]
Given that Jan's current age \( A \) is 30, we substitute this into the equation:
\[ M - 2 = \frac{30}{2} + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 15 + 5 \]
\[ M - 2 = 20 \]
Adding 2 to both sides gives us:
\[ M = 22 \]

Now that we know Mark's current age \( M \) is 22, we can find Jean's current age using the first equation:

"To determine how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the total time it takes for each team to complete the race.

**Faster Team Calculation:**
Each member runs their 400-meter leg in exactly 55 seconds. Since there are four runners:

\[ \text{Total time} = 4 \times 55 \text{ seconds} \]

Calculating the total time:

\[ 4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds} \]

So, the faster team completes the race in 220 seconds.

**Slower Team Calculation:**
The slower team's times follow an arithmetic sequence where the first term (first runner) is 60 seconds, and each subsequent runner is 3 seconds faster than the previous one.

The sequence of times is as follows:
- First runner: \( T_1 = 60 \) seconds
- Second runner: \( T_2 = 60 - 3 \) seconds
- Third runner: \( T_3 = 60 - 6 \) seconds
- Fourth runner: \( T_4 = 60 - 9 \) seconds

We can sum these times using the formula for the"
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row on a six-sided die, we need to calculate both probabilities and then find the difference between them.

### Step 1: Calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3

A six-sided die has faces numbered from 1 to 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. Thus, there are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes.

\[ P(\text{Number} > 3) = \frac{\text{Favorable Outcomes}}{\text{Total Outcomes}} = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2} = 0.5 \]

So, the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 is \(0.5\) or 50%.

### Step 2: Calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row

An even number on a six-sided die is either 2, 4, or 6. There are 3 even numbers out of 6 possible outcomes.

The probability of rolling an even number first is:

\[ P(\text{First Even}) = \"
"Let's break it down step by step:

1. We know that Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother.
2. Her mother picked 20 apples.
3. Therefore, Jenna picked \( \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10 \) apples.
4. To find out how many apples they both picked together, we add Jenna's and her mother's amounts: \( 20 + 10 = 30 \).

So, Jenna and her mother picked a total of 30 apples."
"To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to calculate the number of rats based on the information provided about the distribution of straw.

Firstly, let's summarize what we know:

- The total amount of straw distributed to all rodents is 160 pieces.
- Each rat gets 6 pieces of straw.
- The hamsters get 5 pieces of straw each.
- There are 10 cages of hamsters.
- The rabbit pen receives 20 pieces of straw.

Let's denote the number of rats as \( R \).

Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw, so the total straw given to the rats would be \( 6R \). 

We can write an equation representing the total straw given away:
\[ 6R = 160 \]

Solving for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{160}{6} \]
\[ R = 26.67 \]

Since the number of rats must be a whole number, it appears there might be an error or misinterpretation because typically you wouldn't have a fractional number of animals. However, if we consider rounding to the nearest whole number, it suggests there may be an issue with the data or calculation method. Given typical"
"To calculate the amount Mandy needs to give Benedict considering a 2% monthly interest over three months:

First, we need to calculate the compound interest on $100 over three months.

Interest per month = Principal × Rate

Let's use P as the principal ($100) and R as the rate (2%).

Interest per month = $100 × 2% = $100 × 0.02 = $2

Now, let's calculate the total interest accumulated over three months:

Total Interest = Interest per month × Number of months
               = $2 × 3
               = $6

So, if Mandy pays off the debt immediately without interest, she would owe $100. However, due to the 2% monthly interest, the actual amount she needs to repay is higher than what she initially owed.

Therefore, Mandy should give Benedict an amount equal to the original debt plus the total interest accrued over the three months.

Amount to be given back = Original Debt + Total Interest
                       = $100 + $6
                       = $106

Hence, Mandy should give Benedict $106 to settle the debt after accounting for the interest."
"To find out how many bags the trader sold, we first need to calculate the total cost incurred by the trader:

Cost of buying the bags = Number of bags × Cost per bag
                         = x × $20

Transporting these bags also incurs a cost of $2 per bag:

Total transportation cost = Number of bags × Transportation cost per bag
                          = x × $2

Now, let's denote the number of bags sold as 'x'. The profit is given as $400, which includes both the profit from selling the bags and the transportation cost. Therefore,

Profit = Revenue - (Cost of buying + Transportation cost)
       = ($30 × x) - (($20 × x) + ($2 × x))
       = $400

Solving this equation will give us the value of 'x':

$30x - ($20x + $2x) = $400
$30x - $22x = $400
$x = $400 / ($30 - $22)
    = $400 / $8
    = 50

So, the trader sold 50 bags of wheat."
"First, let's calculate the total amount spent on food:

Total spent on food = Total spent on tickets - $4.50
Total spent on food = ($20.25 - $4.50)
Total spent on food = $15.75

Now, let's find out the total amount spent on rides:

Total spent on rides = Number of rides × Cost per ride
Total spent on rides = 2 × $33
Total spent on rides = $66

Next, we'll add up the total expenses:

Total expenses = Total spent on tickets + Total spent on food + Total spent on rides
Total expenses = $20.25 + $15.75 + $66
Total expenses = $102.00

Since the three friends will share this total expense equally, we'll divide it by 3:

Cost per person = Total expenses ÷ Number of people
Cost per person = $102.00 ÷ 3
Cost per person = $34.00

Each friend paid $34.00."
"To find out how many peaches John collects, you need to multiply the number of minutes he spends collecting by the rate at which he collects peaches per minute.

There are 60 minutes in an hour, so:

\( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ minutes/hour} = 180 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, if John can collect 2 peaches every minute, then:

\( 180 \text{ minutes} \times 2 \text{ peaches/minute} = 360 \text{ peaches} \)

So, John collects 360 peaches."
"To find out how many pounds of insects the entire flock needs per day, we first calculate the weekly insect consumption:

\[ \text{Weekly insect consumption} = 10 \text{ ducks} \times 3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \]

\[ \text{Weekly insect consumption} = 35 \text{ pounds/week} \]

Now, since there are 7 days in a week, we divide this by 7 to get the daily consumption:

\[ \text{Daily insect consumption} = \frac{\text{Weekly insect consumption}}{7} \]

\[ \text{Daily insect consumption} = \frac{35}{7} \]

\[ \text{Daily insect consumption} = 5 \text{ pounds/day} \]

So, the entire flock of ten ducks needs 5 pounds of insects per day."
"To determine how many trees Tom has left after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the net change in the number of trees per year:**
   - Tom plants 10 new trees each year.
   - He chucks down 2 trees each year.
   - Net change = Number of trees planted - Number of trees chopped down
   \[
   \text{Net change} = 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees}

Now, let's compare the numbers:
- Pink flamingos on Sunday: 18
- White flamingos on Sunday: 12

To find how many more pink flamingos there are compared to"
"To determine how much change Violetta will receive, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of crayons Violetta plans to buy.
2. Determine the total cost of the crayons.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has to find the change.

First, let's calculate the total number of crayons Violetta plans to buy. Since she needs one crayon per color and there are 5 different colors, she needs 5 crayons.

Next, let's determine the total cost of the crayons. Each crayon costs $2, so for 5 crayons, the total cost would be:
\[ 5 \text{ crayons} \times \$2 \text{ per crayon} = \$10 \]

Now, let's subtract the total cost from the amount of money Violetta has to find the change:
\[ \$20 - \$10 = \$10 \]

Therefore, the change Violetta will receive is $\boxed{10}$.

"To determine the cost of 8 pens, we first need to find out the cost of one pen. We know that:

1. The price of a pencil (P) is $1.20.
2. The price of an eraser (E) is $0.30.
3. The cost of a pen (Pen) equals the sum of the prices of a pencil and an eraser: Pen = P + E.

Let's calculate the cost of one pen:

\[ \text{Pen} = P + E = 1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50 \]

So, one pen costs $1.50. 

Now, if you want to find the cost of 8 pens, simply multiply the price of one pen by 8:

\[ \text{Cost of 8 pens} = 8 \times \text{Pen} = 8 \times 1.50 \]

Let's perform this multiplication:

\[ 8 \times 1.50 = 12.00 \]

Therefore, 8 pens will cost $12.00."
"To find out how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we need to calculate how many pounds of carrots all the restaurants are receiving together and then subtract this amount from the total number of pounds available.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots, and there are 40 restaurants:

Total pounds of carrots given away by all restaurants = Number of restaurants × Pounds per restaurant

= 40 × 2
= 80 pounds

Now, subtract the total pounds of carrots given away from the total pounds available:

Pounds of carrots not used = Total pounds available - Total pounds given away

= 200 - 80
= 120 pounds

So, 120 pounds of carrots will not be used."
"To find out how many children are in Soda, we need to subtract the number of adults (men and women) from the total population:

Total Population = Number of Men + Number of Women + Number of Children

Let's denote the number of children as C.

So,

C = Total Population - (Number of Men + Number of Women)

Given that the total population is 23786, the number of men is 8417, and the number of women is 9092, we can substitute these values into the equation:

C = 23786 - (8417 + 9092)
C = 23786 - 17509
C = 6277

Therefore, there are 6277 children in Soda."
"Let's break down Elaine's card collection over the three months:

**Month 1:**
Elaine starts with 20 Pokemon cards.

**Month 2:**
She collects three times as many cards as she had in Month 1. So, she collects \(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.

**Month 3:**
In this month, she collects 20 fewer cards than she did in Month 1. Therefore, she collects \(20 - 20 = 0\) cards.

Now let's sum up all the cards she has collected over the three months:

- Month 1: 20 cards
- Month 2: 60 cards
- Month 3: 0 cards

Total number of cards = \(20 + 60 + 0 = 80\)

So, Elaine has 80 Pokemon cards in total now."
"To find out how much Mark makes in a week, we first need to calculate how many sentences he gets paid for from each publisher.

Publisher A pays Mark 5 cents per sentence. Since he edits 1000 sentences, the amount he earns from Publisher A is:

\( 1000 \text{ sentences} \times \$0.05/\text{sentence} = \$50 \)

Since Publisher B pays him twice as much per sentence as Publisher A, it would pay him \( 2 \times \$0.05 = \$0.10 \) per sentence.

Now, let's calculate how much he earns from Publisher B by multiplying the number of sentences edited by Publisher B (which is also 1000) by the rate paid by Publisher B:

\( 1000 \text{ sentences} \times \$0.10/\text{sentence} = \$100 \)

Finally, we add the earnings from both publishers together to get the total weekly earnings:

\( \$50 + \$100 = \$150 \)

So, Mark makes \$150 in a week."
"To calculate the total amount of water Baldur drinks every day, we need to consider both his morning and afternoon intake:

Morning intake: 5 pails/day * 5 liters/pail = 25 liters/day

Afternoon intake: 6 pails/day * 5 liters/pail = 30 liters/day

Total daily intake: Morning intake + Afternoon intake
= 25 liters/day + 30 liters/day
= 55 liters/day

"To calculate John's earnings for the entire year, we need to consider both the one-time award and the annual salary increase.

Firstly, let's calculate the total amount earned by adding the award money to the increased salary:

Award money: $5000

Salary increase: 5% of his weekly salary ($2000)
\[ \text{Increase} = 0.05 \times \$2000 = \$100 \]

Annual salary (before the increase): \( 52 \) weeks/year × \$2000/week = \$104,000

Now add the award money to the increased salary:
\[ Total\ Earnings = \$5000 + \$104,000 = \$109,000 \]

So, John made $109,000 in the year."
"To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of grapes produced by all acres.
2. Convert the total grapes into barrels of wine.

First, calculate the total amount of grapes produced by all acres:
\[ \text{Total grapes} = 10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons} \]

Next, convert the total grapes into barrels of wine:
\[ \text{Barrels of wine} = 50 \text{ tons} \times 2 \text{ barrels/ton} = 100 \text{ barrels} \]

So, Josie's farm produces 100 barrels of wine per year."
"To find out how many slices of cheese Carl used, we need to calculate the number of slices he used for each type of food:

For sandwiches:
He eats a sandwich every day and uses 2 slices of cheese per sandwich. Since there are 7 days in a week, he would use 2 slices/day * 7 days = 14 slices of cheese for sandwiches.

For omelets:
He eats a cheese and egg omelet 3 days in the week and uses one more slice per omelet than he did per sandwich. Since he uses 2 slices per sandwich, he uses 2+1=3 slices per omelet. Thus, for 3 days, he would use 3 slices/omelet * 3 omelets = 9 slices of cheese for omelets.

For macaroni and cheese:
He makes a big dish of macaroni and cheese and uses 8 slices of cheese.

Now, let's add up all the slices of cheese used:

Sandwiches: 14 slices
Omelets: 9 slices
Macaroni and cheese: 8 slices

Total slices of cheese used: 14 + 9 + 8 = 31 slices.

So"
"First, we calculate the number of blue pens Janet has:

Each bag contains 9 pens, and she bought 6 bags of blue pens. Therefore, the total number of blue pens is:
\[ 9 \text{ pens/bag} \times 6 \text{ bags} = 54 \text{ blue pens} \]

Next, we calculate the number of red pens Janet has:

Each bag contains 6 pens, and she bought 2 bags of red pens. Therefore, the total number of red pens is:
\[ 6 \text{ pens/bag} \times 2 \text{ bags} = 12 \text{ red pens} \]

Now, we sum up all the pens Janet has:

She initially had 22 green pens and 10 yellow pens, which totals:
\[ 22 \text{ green pens} + 10 \text{ yellow pens} = 32 \text{ pens} \]

Adding the new pens she bought:
\[ 32 \text{ initial pens} + 54 \text{ blue pens} + 12 \text{ red pens} = 98 \text{ pens} \]

So, Janet now has a total of"
"To find out what score Brinley needs on the sixth test to achieve an average of 93, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the sum of the first five test scores.
2. Determine the total points needed for a 93 average over all six tests.
3. Subtract the sum of the first five test scores from the total points needed for a 93 average.

Let's start with step one:

Sum of the first five test scores:
\[ 89 + 71 + 92 + 100 + 86 = 448 \]

Now, let \( x \) represent the score Brinley needs on the sixth test. To achieve an average of 93 over six tests, the following equation must hold true:

\[
\frac{448 + x}{6} = 93
\]

Multiply both sides by 6 to solve for \( x \):

\[
448 + x = 93 \times 6
\]
\[
448 + x = 558
\]

Subtract 448 from both sides to isolate \( x \):

\[
x = 558 - 448"
"To find out how many kilometers Micheal cycled over the entire period, we need to calculate the distance he cycled during both phases separately and then add them together.

First phase: 
He rides at least 5 times a week for 4 weeks. Each time he cycles 25 km. 

So, for one week, he would cycle \( 5 \times 25 \) km. 

For 4 weeks, this becomes:

\( 4 \times (5 \times 25) \)

Second phase:
He decides to ride 2 times a week for 3 weeks, each time cycling 60 km.

This would become:

\( 2 \times 60 \times 3 \)

Now let's calculate these values step by step:

First phase calculation:

\( 4 \times (5 \times 25) \)
\( 4 \times (125) \)
\( 4 \times 125 = 500 \) km

Second phase calculation:

\( 2 \times 60 \times 3 \)
\( 120 \times 3 \)
\( 120 \times 3 = 360 \) km

"First, we need to determine the weight of each candied apple. Since each chocolate bar weighs twice as much as each candied apple, and a chocolate bar weighs 40 grams, then each candied apple would weigh:

\( \frac{40\text{ g}}{2} = 20\text{ g} \)

Now that we know each candied apple weighs 20 grams, we can calculate the total weight of all the candies in Joe's bag:

For the chocolate bars:
\( 25\text{ bars} \times 40\text{ g/bar} = 1000\text{ g} \)

For the candied apples:
\( 80\text{ apples} \times 20\text{ g/apple} = 1600\text{ g} \)

Adding these together gives us the total weight of Joe's bag of candy:

\( 1000\text{ g} + 1600\text{ g} = 2600\text{ g} \)

So, Joe's bag of candy weighs 2600 grams."
"To find out how many cakes Rose bought over the three days, we need to calculate the number of cakes she bought each day and then sum them up:

1. **Monday**: She bought 4 cakes.
   \[
   \text{Cakes bought on Monday} = 4
   \]

2. **Tuesday**: She bought three times as many cakes as she did on Monday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes bought on Tuesday} = 3 \times 4 = 12
   \]

3. **Wednesday**: She bought five times as many cakes as she did on Tuesday.
   \[
   \text{Cakes bought on Wednesday} = 5 \times 12 = 60
   \]

Now, add the cakes bought on each day together:
\[
\text{Total cakes bought} = 4 (\text{Monday}) + 12 (\text{Tuesday}) + 60 (\text{Wednesday})
\]
\[
\text{Total cakes bought} = 4 + 12 + 60 = 76
\]

So, Rose bought a total of 76 cakes after all three days."
"To calculate the total cost of buying each cup, we need to first find out the cost of half a dozen plates:

Cost of half a dozen plates = 6 × $6000 = $36000

Now, according to the problem statement, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. 

So, let's subtract $1200 from the cost of half a dozen plates to get the total cost of twenty dozen cups:

Total cost of twenty dozen cups = $36000 - $1200 = $34800

Finally, to find the cost of one cup, we divide this amount by the number of dozens (which is 20):

Cost per cup = $34800 ÷ 20 = $1740

Therefore, the total cost of buying each cup is $1740."
"To determine how many times Sara needs to mow the lawn to afford both the jacket and shoes, we first need to calculate the total cost of these items.

1. **Cost of the Jacket**: 
   \[
   \text{Jacket Cost} = \$30
   \]

2. **Cost of Shoes**:
   \[
   \text{Shoes Cost per Pair} = \$20
   \]
   Since Sara wants 2 pairs of shoes:
   \[
   \text{Total Shoes Cost} = 2 \times \$20 = \$40
   \]

3. **Total Cost of Items**:
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = \$30 (\text{jacket}) + \$40 (\text{shoes}) = \$70

"Let's denote the number of red chickens as \( R \) and the number of white chickens as \( W \).

From the problem statement, we know:

1. Red chickens produce 3 eggs per day.
2. White chickens produce 5 eggs per day.
3. Jerry collects 42 eggs daily.
4. Jerry has two more white chickens than red chickens (\( W = R + 2 \)).

We can set up an equation based on these facts:

\[ 3R + 5W = 42 \]

Substituting \( W \) with \( R + 2 \):

\[ 3R + 5(R + 2) = 42 \]

Expanding this equation gives us:

\[ 3R + 5R + 10 = 42 \]

Combining like terms:

\[ 8R + 10 = 42 \]

Now, let's solve for \( R \):

\[ 8R = 42 - 10 \]
\[ 8R = 32 \]
\[ R = \frac{32}{8} \]
\[ R = 4 \]

So, Jerry has 4 red chickens."
"To find out how long Gary spends walking around the park, we first need to calculate the perimeter of the rectangular park since it's the distance he will cover while walking around its edges. The formula for the perimeter \( P \) of a rectangle is given by:

\[ P = 2(l + w) \]

where \( l \) is the length and \( w \) is the width of the rectangle. In this case, the length \( l \) is 6 miles and the width \( w \) is 1.5 miles. Plugging these values into the formula gives us:

\[ P = 2(6 + 1.5) = 2(7.5) = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Now that we know the perimeter (distance walked), we can use the speed at which Gary walks to determine how long he takes to complete this distance. Given that he walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour, the time \( T \) taken can be calculated as follows:

\[ T = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, Gary spends 5 hours walking around the park"
"On the second day, Sloane counted 50 more customers than the first day. Since she counted 100 customers on the first day, on the second day she would have counted:

100 (first day's count) + 50 = 150 customers

By the third day, the total number of customers was 500. To find out how many customers Sloane counted on the third day, we subtract the number of customers counted on the first and second days from the total:

500 (total for three days) - 100 (first day) - 150 (second day) = 150 customers

So, Sloane counted 150 customers on the third day."
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as \( S \) (in gallons). 

Given that the big pool leaks at a rate of 4 gallons per minute, it would leak out over 4 minutes, which amounts to \( 4 \times 4 = 16 \) gallons.

We know that 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Therefore, if we let \( T \) represent the time when the situation was last equal (before 4 minutes ago), then:

\[ \text{Big Pool} \quad \text{(at } T\text{)} = 2S \]
\[ \text{Small Pool} \quad (\text{at } T) = S \]

Since 4 minutes ago, the big pool leaked out 16 gallons, we can express its current amount of water as:

\[ \text{Current Big Pool Water} = 2S - 16 \]

And since the small pool hasn't leaked yet because we're looking at the moment just before 4 minutes ago, its current amount of water remains \( S \).

Now, according to the problem statement, the big pool currently has four times as much water as the"
"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford both the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of these items:

Cost of shoes: $320.00
Cost of belt: $32.00

Total cost = Cost of shoes + Cost of belt
Total cost = $320.00 + $32.00
Total cost = $352.00

Now that we know the total amount Lori needs to spend ($352.00), we'll divide this by her hourly wage to find out how many hours she needs to work:

Hourly wage: $8.00 per hour

Number of hours needed = Total cost / Hourly wage
Number of hours needed = $352.00 / $8.00 per hour
Number of hours needed = 44 hours

Therefore, Lori will need to work 44 hours before she can afford both the shoes and the belt."
"To calculate Janeth's remaining balance after paying back the loan plus interest over 12 months, follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay:**

"To find out the total number of flowers in the vase, you need to first determine how many dahlias there are. 

Given that there are 7 more dahlias than roses:

Number of dahlias = Number of roses + 7

Since we know there are 4 roses,

Number of dahlias = 4 + 7 = 11

Now add the number of roses and dahlias together to get the total number of flowers:

Total number of flowers = Number of roses + Number of dahlias

Total number of flowers = 4 + 11 = 15

So, there are 15 flowers in the vase in total."
"First, we determine Harriet's current age by using the information given:

Harriet's current age = 21 years

Now we find Adrian's current age based on the relationship between Adrian's and Harriet's ages:

Adrian's current age = 3 × Harriet's current age = 3 × 21 = 63 years

Next, we calculate Zack's current age by considering the relationship between Harriet's and Zack's ages:

Zack's current age = 2 × Harriet's current age = 2 × 21 = 42 years

Now, let's add three years to each person's age to find their ages in three years:

Harriet's age in three years = 21 + 3 = 24 years
Adrian's age in three years = 63 + 3 = 66 years
Zack's age in three years = 42 + 3 = 45 years

To find the average age of the three people in three years, we sum up their ages and divide by three:

Average age = (Harriet's age in three years + Adrian's age in three years + Zack's age in three years) / 3
Average age"
"To find out how many points Jojo scored, we need to first calculate the number of points scored by Yuri, Brianna, and then subtract these scores from the total points scored by all four students.

Naomi's score is given directly as 68 points.

Yuri scored 10 more than half as many points as Naomi. To calculate this:

\( \text{Yuri's Score} = \frac{\text{Naomi's Score}}{2} + 10 \)

\( \text{Yuri's Score} = \frac{68}{2} + 10 \)

\( \text{Yuri's Score} = 34 + 10 \)

"To calculate the total time Carmen spent on solving puzzles over the weekend, we need to add up the time taken for both crosswords and sudokus.

For crosswords:
Carmen took 10 minutes per crossword puzzle, and she completed 3 crossword puzzles. 
So, the total time spent on crosswords = 10 minutes/puzzle × 3 puzzles = 30 minutes

For sudokus:
Carmen took 5 minutes per Sudoku puzzle, and she completed 8 Sudoku puzzles.
So, the total time spent on Sudokus = 5 minutes/puzzle × 8 puzzles = 40 minutes

Now, let's add the times together:

Total time spent = Time spent on Crosswords + Time spent on Sudokus
                = 30 minutes + 40 minutes

"To find out how many liters of water are in the tank now, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Determine the amount of water remaining after Celine uses it:** 
   The initial amount of water in the tank is 120 liters. Celine uses 90 liters of water to water her garden. Therefore, the remaining amount of water is:
   \[
   120 - 90 = 30 \text{ liters}
   \]

2. **Calculate the amount of rainwater collected:**
   Rainwater collected is twice the amount of water that remained after Celine's usage. Thus, the amount of rainwater collected is:

"To find out the total number of flowers Andy plants, we need to first calculate how many petunias he plants. Since Andy plants 40 fewer petunias than geraniums, we subtract 40 from the number of geraniums:

Number of petunias = Number of geraniums - 40

Now let's substitute the given numbers into this equation:

Number of petunias = 90 (geraniums) - 40 = 50 petunias

Next, we add the number of geraniums and petunias together to get the total number of flowers planted:

Total flowers = Geraniums + Petunias

Substituting the known values:

Total flowers = 90 (geraniums) + 50 (petunias)

Therefore,

Total flowers = 140

So, Andy plants a total of 140 flowers."

"To calculate the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type:

First, we need to find out the new number of water type cards James has after losing 8 of them. Initially, he had 40 water type cards, so after losing 8, he'll have:

\[ \text{Water Type Cards} = 40 - 8 = 32 \]

Next, we add the newly acquired grass type cards to this count since buying new ones doesn't change the existing number of water type cards. James bought 14 grass type cards, which increases the total number of cards by 14. Therefore, the new total number of cards is:

\[ \text{Total Cards} = 32 \text{ (water)} + 14 \text{ (grass)} = 46 \]

Now, to find the percentage chance that a randomly picked card will be a water type, we divide the number of water type cards by the total number of cards and multiply by 100:

"To find out how much Mark pays for everything, we need to calculate the total cost of the cars including taxes and registration fees.

First, let's calculate the cost of the cars without considering the tax or registration fee:

Cost of one car = $20,000

Total cost of 12 cars = 12 * $20,000 = $240,000

Next, let's calculate the tax on the cars:

Tax rate = 10%

Tax amount per car = 10/100 * $20,000 = $2,000

Now, let's calculate the total tax for all 12 cars:

Total tax = 12 * $2,000 = $24,000

Finally, let's add up the cost of the cars, the tax, and the registration fees:

Registration fee per car = $1,000

Total registration fees = 12 * $1,000 = $12,000

Total payment = Cost of cars + Total tax + Total registration fees

Total payment = $240,000 + $24,00"
"On Monday, Robert collected 20 shells. Since Kylie collected 5 more shells than Robert, Kylie collected 20 + 5 = 25 shells on Monday.

"To find out how many penguins are still sunbathing, we need to subtract those who jumped into the ocean and went inside the cave from the initial number of penguins.

First, let's calculate how many penguins jumped into the ocean:

One-third of the penguins = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)

So, 12 penguins jumped into the ocean.

Next, let's calculate how many penguins went inside the cave:

Another one-third of the penguins = \( \frac{1}{3} \times 36 = 12 \)

So, 12 penguins went inside the cave.

Now, let's add up these numbers to see how many penguins have gone away:

\( 12 (jumped into the ocean) + 12 (went inside the cave) = 24 \)

Subtract this number from the original amount to find out how many are still sunbathing:

\( 36 (original number) - 24 (gone away) = 12 \)

Therefore, there are 12 penguins still sunbathing."

Given that Steve eats twice as much as his girlfriend, let's denote the number of tomatoes his girlfriend eats per day as \( x \). Therefore, Steve eats \( 2x \) tomatoes per day.

We know that Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day, so we set up the equation:

\[ 2x = 6 \]

Solving for \( x \):

\[ x = \frac{6}{2} = 3 \]

So, his girlfriend eats 3 tomatoes per day, and Steve eats 6 tomatoes per day.

Next, we calculate how many tomatoes Steve eats in one week. Since there are 7 days in a week:

\[ \text{Tomatoes consumed per week by Steve} = 6 \times 7 = 42 \]

Now, we know that each vine produces 3 tomatoes per week. To find out how many vines Steve needs, we divide the total number of tomatoes he consumes in a week by the number of tomatoes produced by one vine per week:

\[ \text{Number of vines needed} = \frac{\text{Total tomatoes consumed per week}}{\text{Tomatoes produced per vine"
"To determine how many pizzas John needs to order, we can follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of pizza slices needed.
   - Each friend gets 4 slices.
   - There are 20 friends.
   \[
   4 \text{ slices/friend} \times 20 \text{ friends} = 80 \text{ slices}
   \]

2. Determine how many slices one pizza provides.
   - Each pizza is cut into 8 slices.

3. Calculate the number of pizzas required by dividing the total number of slices needed by the number of slices per pizza.
   \[
   \frac{80 \text{ slices}}{8 \text{ slices/pizza}} = 10 \text{ pizzas}
   \]

Therefore, John needs to order **10 pizzas** to ensure everyone gets 4 slices each."
"To determine how many total pens Ram gets, we need to consider the following:

1. **Initial Pens**: Ram starts with 25 pens.
   
2. **Ink Usage**: Since Ram mixes ink from five empty pens to make one full pen, it implies that each full pen uses exactly five units of ink (one unit per pen).

3. **Total Ink Units**: The total number of ink units available initially is \(25 \times 5\) because each of the 25 pens contains 5 units of ink.

4. **New Pens Produced**: With these 250 ink units, Ram will produce new pens where each new pen requires five units of ink. Thus, the number of new pens he can make is given by dividing the total ink units by 5:

\[
\frac{250}{5} = 50
\]

5. **Final Calculation**:
   - Initially, Ram has 25 pens.
   - Using these 25 pens to make 50 new pens results in 50 additional pens.
   - Therefore, the total number of pens Ram ends up with is:

\[
25 + 50 = 75
\]

Thus, Ram gets a"
"First, Johnny adds the extra $10 to his initial $20 allowance:

$20 (initial allowance) + $10 (extra amount) = $30

Now, we know that his investment triples in value over a year. Since he invested the $30, the value would increase by a factor of three:

$30 * 3 = $90

So, after one year, Johnny's money would grow to $90."
"Let's break down the information given:

1. Jessa is 20 years old.
2. Joan is five years older than Jessa.
   - Therefore, Joan's age = Jessa's age + 5 = 20 + 5 = 25 years.
3. Mary is two years younger than Joan.
   - Therefore, Mary's age = Joan's age - 2 = 25 - 2 = 23 years.

Now we know the ages of all three girls:
- Mary is 23 years old,
- Joan is 25 years old,
- Jessa is 20 years old.

To find the sum of their ages, we add them together:
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = \text{Mary's age} + \text{Joan's age} + \text{Jessa's age} \]
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = 23 + 25 + 20 \]
\[ \text{Sum of ages} = 68 \]

Therefore, the sum of the ages of the three girls is 68 years."
"To find the number of students who went out through exit C, we'll follow these steps:

1. Calculate the number of students who went out through exit A.
2. Subtract those from the initial count to get the remaining students.
3. Determine the number of students who went out through exit B using the remaining students.
4. Finally, subtract the students going through B from the remaining students to get the final number going out through exit C.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. **Students leaving through Exit A**:
   \[
   30\% \text{ of } 1000 = 0.30 \times 1000 = 300 \text{ students}
   \]

2. **Remaining students after Exit A**:
   \[
   1000 - 300 = 700 \text{ students}
   \]

3. **Students leaving through Exit B**:
   \[
   \frac{3}{5} \text{ of } 700 = \frac{3}{5} \times 700 = 420 \text{ students}
   \]

4. **Students leaving through Exit C"
"Let's denote the number of candies Robert has as \( R \).

According to the information given:

John has twice as many candies as Robert, which can be written as:
\[ J = 2R \]

We know John has 54 candies, so we can substitute this value into our equation:
\[ 54 = 2R \]

Now, let's solve for \( R \):
\[ R = \frac{54}{2} \]
\[ R = 27 \]

So, Robert has 27 candies.

Next, we're told that James has 6 more candies than Robert. Let's calculate the number of candies James has:
\[ J_{\text{James}} = R + 6 \]
\[ J_{\text{James}} = 27 + 6 \]
\[ J_{\text{James}} = 33 \]

Now, we need to find out how many more candies John has compared to James:
\[ \text{Difference} = J - J_{\text{James}} \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 54 - 33 \]
\[ \text{Difference} = 21 \]

Therefore, John has 21 more candies than"
"To determine the total number of books that Dolly and Pandora will collectively read by the end, we need to consider both the original number of books they possess and any additional books they might read due to reading each other's books.

1. **Original Number of Books**:
   - Dolly starts with 2 books.
   - Pandora starts with 1 book.

   Therefore, together they start with \(2 + 1 = 3\) books.

2. **Books Read Due to Reading Each Other's Books**:
   - When Dolly reads Pandora's book, it counts as a new book for Pandora and another book for Dolly.
   - Similarly, when Pandora reads Dolly's book, it also counts as a new book for Dolly and another book for Pandora.

   This means that each book read between them adds 2 more books to their collective count (one for each person).

3. **Total Books Read**:
   Since they exchange books twice (once for each book), the total number of additional books they add to their collection is \(2 \times 2 = 4\).

4. **Final Count**:
   Adding these extra books to their original collection gives us \(3 + 4 = 7\).

So,"
"First find the total number of letters Mike receives per week: 2 letters/person * 5 people = 10 letters/week
Then multiply that number by the length of each letter to find the total weekly letter count: 10 letters/week * 5 pages/letter = 50 pages/week
Then divide that amount by the number of minutes it takes him to write one page to find the time spent writing per week: 50 pages/week / 6 minutes/page = 8. 33 minutes/week
Then multiply that time by the number of weeks in a month to find the monthly writing time: 8. 33 minutes/week * 4 weeks/month = 33. 33 minutes/month

Therefore, the answer is 5."
"To find out how many minutes Jason has left on his phone plan, we need to subtract the time he spends on calls from the total minutes allowed by his plan.

First, let's calculate the total minutes spent calling his boss:

He makes a 15-minute call every day, and there are 30 days in the month, so:

\( 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \)

Now, add the extra minutes he used for other calls:

\( 450 \text{ minutes (boss calls)} + 300 \text{ minutes (other calls)} = 750 \text{ minutes} \)

Finally, subtract these total minutes from the monthly allowance:

\( 1000 \text{ minutes/month} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \)

So, Jason has 250 minutes left on his phone plan this month."
"To determine how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial Count**:
   - Griffin starts with 24 fries.

2. **Kyle Takes Fries**:
   - Kyle takes 5 fries.
   
   Remaining fries with Griffin: 
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]

3. **Billy Takes Fries**:
   - Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle.
   
   Number of fries Billy takes:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10

"To solve this problem, let's denote:

- \( S_1 \) as the number of snails in the first aquarium,
- \( S_2 \) as the number of snails in the second aquarium,
- \( F \) as the number of fish in each aquarium.

From the information given, we know that:

\( S_1 = 4 \)
\( S_2 = 32 \)

We also know that the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums combined. Mathematically, this can be expressed as:

\( |S_1 - S_2| = 2F \)

Substituting the values of \( S_1 \) and \( S_2 \), we get:

\( |4 - 32| = 2F \)

Now, calculate the absolute value on the left side:

\( |-28| = 28 \)

So,

\( 28 = 2F \)

Divide both sides by 2 to find \( F \):

\( F = \frac{28}{2} \)
\( F = 14 \)

Therefore, there are 14 fish in each"
"First, we calculate the daily cost without any discounts:

Daily cost = Hourly rate × Hours per day
           = $250 × 6
           = $1500

Next, we calculate the weekly cost before the discount:

Weekly cost (without discount) = Daily cost × Number of days per week
                               = $1500 × 4
                               = $6000

Now, we calculate the total cost for all four weeks:

Total cost (before discount) = Weekly cost (without discount) × Number of weeks
                            = $6000 × 4
                            = $24000

Finally, we apply the 10% discount:

Discounted total cost = Total cost (before discount) × (1 - Discount percentage)
                     = $24000 × (1 - 0.10)
                     = $24000 × 0.90
                     = $21600

So, Jean paid $21,600 after the 10% discount."
"To find out how much each person paid, we first need to calculate the total amount Isabelle spent on all the party supplies:

Total spent = Cost of cake + Cost of presents + Cost of decorations + Cost of invitations + Cost of goodie bags
           = $12 + $43 + $15 + $4 + $22
           = $100

Now, we divide this total by 3 (since she splits it evenly among herself and her two parents):

Cost per person = Total spent / Number of people
               = $100 / 3
               ≈ $33.33

So, each person paid approximately $33.33 for the party supplies."
"To determine how much the chef spent on the onions, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the total weight of onions purchased**:  
   The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. Therefore, the total weight is:
   \[
   4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds per bag} = 200 \text{ pounds}
   \]

2. **Calculate the total cost based on price per pound**:
   Each pound of onions costs $1.50. Thus, the total cost is:
   \[
   200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50 \text{ per pound} = \$300
   \]

Therefore, the chef spent a total of $\boxed{300}$ dollars."
"Let's break down the information given:

- Sue ate 4 times as many cookies as her sister on Monday.
- Her sister ate 5 cookies on Monday.
- Sue ate twice as many cookies as her sister on Tuesday.
- Her sister ate 13 cookies on Tuesday.

First, let's calculate how many cookies Sue ate on Monday and Tuesday:

- On Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 13 = 26\) cookies.

Now, let's find out how many cookies her sister ate over the two days:

- On Monday, her sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, her sister ate 13 cookies.

So, her sister ate a total of \(5 + 13 = 18\) cookies.

Next, we'll determine how many more calories Sue consumed compared to her sister by calculating their total calorie intake:

- Since 1 cookie contains 200 calories,
- Sue ate \(20 + 26 = 46\) cookies (Monday + Tuesday).
- Therefore, Sue consumed \(46 \times 200 = 9200\) calories.

Her sister ate \(18"
