"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Freda used 32 ounces of sauce, which is half the volume of the cans she used.
- Since each can contains three tomatoes and reduces the volume by half, she used 64 tomatoes.
- 64 tomatoes divided by 3 tomatoes per can equals approximately 21.33 cans.
- Therefore, Freda used about 21 and a third cans of tomatoes.
- However, since you can't have a fraction of a can, Freda used 21 cans and had a little bit left over.
- So, Freda used 21 and a third cans of tomatoes.

- First, let's calculate the total number of pages Solo needs to read.
- He has four textbooks: Science (4 pages), Social Studies (20 pages), History (7 pages), and Geography (8 pages).

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- Let \( x \) be the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year.
- He wanted to bake twice as many as last year, so he intended to bake \( 2x \) cookies.
- However, he actually baked 15 more cookies than he intended, so the actual number of cookies baked is \( 2x + 15 \).
- He dropped 5 cookies, so the number of cookies left is \( (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \).
- According to the problem, after dropping 5 cookies, he has 110 cookies left. Therefore, \( 2x + 10 = 110 \).
- Solving for \( x \): Subtract 10 from both sides to get \( 2x = 100 \), then divide both sides by 2 to find \( x = 50 \).
- Therefore, Henry intended to bake 50 cookies last year.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The gas station sells gas at $3.00 per gallon.
- An app company offers a $0.20 cashback on each gallon purchased at the gas station.
- If someone buys 10 gallons of gas, the total cost is 10 * $3.00 = $30.00.
- The cashback for each gallon is $0.20, so for 10 gallons, the cashback is 10 * $0.20 = $2.00.

"Step-by-Step Answer:
- The hospital sees 500 people each day, each needing 24 minutes of care. So, the total time spent on care per day is 500 * 24 = 12,000 minutes.

- There are 3 cages for rats, each with an equal number of rats.
- Each rat is given 6 pieces of straw.
- 160 pieces of straw have been distributed among the rats.
- To find the number of rats per cage, first, divide the total straw by the number of pieces per rat: 160 ÷ 6 ≈ 26.67.
- However, since the number of rats must be a whole number, this suggests a miscalculation.
- Re-examining the problem, it's likely that the number of rats per cage should be a whole number, so the initial assumption may need adjustment.
- Given the context, it's more plausible that there are 8 rats in each cage, as 3 cages × 8 rats = 24 rats, and 24 × 6 = 144 pieces of straw, which is close to 160 but not exact.
- Therefore, there might be a rounding issue or an error in the problem's data.

- Tom plants 10 trees each year, so his total planting for 10 years is 10 * 10 = 100 trees.
- He chops down 2 trees each year, so his total chopping for 10 years is 2 * 10 = 20 trees.
- The net gain of trees over 10 years is 100 - 20 = 80 trees.
- Initially, there were 50 trees, so after 10 years, the total trees would be 50 + 80 = 130 trees.

- Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool as S gallons.
- Since the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool, the big pool has 4S gallons.
- Four minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. Let's denote the amount of water in the small pool four minutes ago as s gallons.
- Therefore, the big pool had 2s gallons four minutes ago.

- Mark buys a fleet of 12 cars, each costing $20,000. So, the total cost for the cars is 12 * $20,000 = $240,000.
- He pays 10% tax on the cars. The tax amount is 10% of $240,000, which is $24,000.
- After paying the tax, the total cost becomes $240,000 + $24,000 = $264,000.
