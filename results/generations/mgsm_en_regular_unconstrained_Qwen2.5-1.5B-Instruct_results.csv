"To determine Josh's profit from flipping the house, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.
2. Determine the total cost of buying and fixing the house.
3. Subtract the total cost from the new value of the house to find the profit.

**Step 1: Calculate the new value of the house after the repairs.**

The original price of the house is $80,000. The repairs added an additional $50,000 to its value. Therefore, the new value of the house is:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 2: Determine the total cost of buying and fixing the house.**

The total cost includes the purchase price of the house plus the cost of the repairs:
\[ 80,000 + 50,000 = 130,000 \]

**Step 3: Subtract the total cost from the new value of the house to find the profit.**

Since the new value of the house is equal to the total cost of buying and fixing the house, there is no profit or loss:

"To determine how much feed Wendi needs for one chicken in the evening meal, we first calculate the total amount of feed given to all chickens over the course of a day.

Each chicken receives:
- 3 cups of feed per meal,
- There are 3 meals per day.

So, each chicken gets:
\[ 3 \text{ cups/meal} \times 3 \text{ meals/day} = 9 \text{ cups/day} \]

Next, we find out the total amount of feed given to all 20 chickens in a day:
\[ 9 \text{ cups/chicken/day} \times 20 \text{ chickens} = 180 \text{ cups/day} \]

We know that Wendi has already given:
- 15 cups in the morning,
- 25 cups in the afternoon.

So, the total amount of feed given so far is:
\[ 15 \text{ cups} + 25 \text{ cups} = 40 \text{ cups} \]

The remaining amount of feed needed for the evening meal is:
\[ 180 \text{ cups} - 40 \text{ cups} = 140 \text{"
"To determine how much Kylar needs to pay for 16 glasses, we first need to understand the pricing structure. The first glass costs $5, and each subsequent glass costs 60% of the price of a regular glass.

Let's break it down step by step:

1. Calculate the cost of the first glass:
   \[
   \text{Cost of the first glass} = \$5
   \]

2. Determine the cost of the second glass:
   Since the second glass is the second one in line after the first, it will be 60% of the price of a regular glass.
   \[
   \text{Cost of the second glass} = 0.60 \times 5 = \$3
   \]

3. Continue this pattern for all 16 glasses:
   Each subsequent glass will be 60% of the previous glass's price. This forms a geometric sequence where the first term \(a_1\) is $5 and the common ratio \(r\) is 0.60.

The total cost can be calculated using the formula for the sum of a geometric series:
\[
S_n = a_1 \frac{1 - r^n}{1 - r}

"To determine the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle, we start by defining the variables for the number of sheep each city has.

Let:
- \( S \) be the number of sheep in Seattle.
- \( C \) be the number of sheep in Charleston.
- \( T \) be the number of sheep in Toulouse.

We are given that Seattle has 20 sheep, so:
\[ S = 20 \]

Charleston has 4 times as many sheep as Seattle, so:
\[ C = 4S \]
Substituting \( S = 20 \):
\[ C = 4 \times 20 = 80 \]

Toulouse has twice as many sheep as Charleston, so:
\[ T = 2C \]
Substituting \( C = 80 \):
\[ T = 2 \times 80 = 160 \]

Now, we sum the number of sheep from all three cities:
\[ T + C + S = 160 + 80 + 20 = 260 \]

Thus, the total number of sheep among Toulouse, Charleston, and Seattle is:
\[
\boxed{260}

"To determine how far John is from home after his trip, we need to calculate the distance he travels each segment of his journey.

1. **First Segment:**
   - Time: 3 hours
   - Speed: 60 mph
   - Distance traveled: \( 3 \text{ hours} \times 60 \text{ mph} = 180 \text{ miles} \)

2. **Second Segment:**
   - John realizes he forgot something and gets stuck in traffic for the first 2 hours.
   - Total time available to travel is 4 hours, so he can only travel for \( 4 - 2 = 2 \) more hours after accounting for the 2 hours in traffic.
   - However, during these 2 hours, he spends the first hour in traffic (as calculated above), leaving him with 1 hour left to travel.
   - Since he cannot travel faster than his initial speed (60 mph) in this remaining time, he will not be able to complete the full 2 hours as planned.
   - Therefore, the actual time spent traveling is limited by the remaining time minus the time already accounted for:
     - Remaining time: \( 2 \text{ hours} -"
"To calculate Eliza's earnings for the week, we need to break down her work into two parts: the first 40 hours at her regular rate and the remaining 5 hours as overtime.

1. **Regular Hours (First 40 Hours):**
   - Rate per hour = $10
   - Number of hours = 40

   Earnings from regular hours:
   \[
   40 \text{ hours} \times \$10/\text{hour} = \$400
   \]

2. **Overtime Hours (Next 5 Hours):**
   - Overtime rate = \(1.2\) times regular rate
   - Regular rate = $10
   - Overtime rate = \(10 \times 1.2 = \$12\)

"To determine how many years it will take Carlos to start earning money from his lemon tree, we need to calculate the net profit per year and then find out how many years are required for this profit to equal or exceed the initial investment.

First, let's define the variables:
- Initial cost of planting the lemon tree: \( \$90 \)
- Annual growth rate of lemons: 7 lemons per year
- Selling price of each lemon: \( \$1.5 \)
- Watering and feeding cost per year: \( \$3 \)

Next, we calculate the annual revenue from selling the lemons:
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = (\text{Number of Lemons}) \times (\text{Selling Price per Lemon})
\]
Since the tree grows 7 lemons per year:
\[
\text{Annual Revenue} = 7 \times 1.5 = \$10.50
\]

Now, we calculate the total annual expenses (costs):
\[
\text{Total Annual Expenses} = \text{Watering and Feeding Cost}

"To find the original price of the book, we need to determine what price, when discounted by 25%, results in $19.50.

Let's denote the original price as \( P \).

Given that the book has been sold at a 25% discount, it means Kyle paid 75% (or 0.75 times) of the original price. So, we can write:

\[ 0.75P = \$19.50 \]

Now, to find the original price (\( P \)), we divide both sides of the equation by 0.75:

\[ P = \frac{\$19.50}{0.75} \]

\[ P = \$26 \]

So, the original price of the book was $26."

First, let's identify the prices of the two pairs of high heels:
- One pair of high heels costs $33.
- The other pair of high heels costs twice as much as the first pair, which means it costs \(2 \times 33 = 66\) dollars.

Next, calculate the total cost of the two pairs of high heels:
\[
33 + 66 = 99
\]
This means the two pairs of high heels together cost $99. According to the problem, this amount is five dollars less than the cost of the boots. Therefore, if we denote the cost of the boots by \(B\), then we have:
\[
B - 5 = 99
\]
Solving for \(B\):
\[
B = 99 + 5 = 104
\]

Thus, the cost of the boots is \(\boxed{1"
"To determine Allen's age 10 years from now, we start by defining the current ages of Darrell and Allen based on the given ratio and total age.

Let \( D \) be Darrell's current age and \( A \) be Allen's current age. According to the problem, the ratio of their ages is 7:11, which can be expressed as:
\[
\frac{D}{A} = \frac{7}{11}
\]
This implies that there exists a constant \( k \) such that:
\[
D = 7k \quad \text{and} \quad A = 11k
\]

The sum of their current ages is given as 162:
\[
D + A = 162
\]

Substituting the expressions for \( D \) and \( A \) in terms of \( k \):
\[
7k + 11k = 162
\]
Combining like terms:
\[
18k = 162
\]
Solving for \( k \):
\[
k = \frac{162}{18} = 9

Now, we find the current ages of"
"To find the average of Gunter's friends' guesses, we need to calculate each friend's guess and then take the average.

The first friend guessed there were 80 jelly beans.
The second friend guessed that there were 20 more than half of what the first friend guessed. So, this would be:
\( \frac{1}{2} \times 80 + 20 = 40 + 20 = 60 \) jelly beans.

The third friend guessed that there were 25% more than what the first friend guessed. To calculate 25% of 80, we multiply 80 by 0.25:
\( 80 \times 0.25 = 20 \).

Adding this to the original number gives us the third friend's guess:
\( 80 + 20 = 100 \) jelly beans.

Now we can add all three guesses together and divide by the number of guesses (3) to get the average:

\( \text{Average guess} = \frac{80 + 60 + 100}{3} \)

\( \text{Average guess} = \frac{240}{3}"
"To determine how many hours John spends taking care of the dogs each week, we need to break down the problem step by step.

First, let's calculate the number of hours John spends walking and caring for one dog per day:
- Each dog takes 0.5 hours a day.
- Therefore, each dog takes \(0.5\) hours per day.

Next, since John takes care of 10 dogs, we multiply the daily time spent on one dog by the total number of dogs:
\[
0.5 \text{ hours/day/dog} \times 10 \text{ dogs} = 5 \text{ hours/week}
\]

Thus, John spends \(\boxed{5}\) hours a week taking care of the dogs."
"Let's denote the number of silver coins as \( S \) and the number of gold coins as \( G \). According to the problem, we have two pieces of information:

1. The total number of coins is 110.
2. There are 30 more gold coins than silver coins.

We can express these pieces of information with the following equations:
\[ S + G = 110 \]
\[ G = S + 30 \]

Now, we substitute the second equation into the first equation to solve for \( S \):
\[ S + (S + 30) = 110 \]
\[ 2S + 30 = 110 \]
Subtract 30 from both sides:
\[ 2S = 80 \]
Divide by 2:
\[ S = 40 \]

Now that we know there are 40 silver coins, we can find the number of gold coins using the second equation:
\[ G = S + 30 \]
\[ G = 40 + 30 \]
\[ G = 70 \]

Therefore, the number of gold coins Gretchen has is \(\boxed{70}\)."
"To determine how many jewels Siobhan has, we need to follow the information given step by step.

   \[
   \text{Half of Raymond's jewels} = \frac{40}{2} = 20
   \]
   \[
   \text{Aaron's jewels} = 20 + 5 = 25
   \]

3. Determine the number of jewels Siobhan has. The problem states that Siobhan has 2 fewer jewels than Aaron.
   \[
   \text{Siobhan's jewels} = 25 - 2 = 23
   \]

Thus, the number of jewels Siobhan has is \(\boxed{23}\)."
"To determine the total number of points Mike scored in his ping pong match, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the points scored in each segment of the game.
2. Calculate the points scored in the second segment.
3. Sum the points from both segments.

First, we know that in the first 20 minutes, Mike scored 4 points.

Next, we calculate the points scored in the second 20 minutes. According to the problem, he scored 25% more points than he did in the first 20 minutes. To find out how many additional points this is, we calculate 25% of 4 points:
\[ 25\% \text{ of } 4 = 0.25 \times 4 = 1 \]
So, in the second 20 minutes, Mike scored \(4 + 1 = 5\) points.

Now, we add the points from both segments to get the total number of points scored:
\[ 4 \text{ (first 20 minutes)} + 5 \text{ (second 20 minutes)} = 9 \]

Therefore, the total number of points Mike scored is \(\boxed{9}\)."

"To determine how many Lego sets John still has, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets.
2. Determine the total cost of the video games.
3. Find out how much money John had initially by subtracting the cost of the video games and the remaining money from the total amount of money he made.

First, let's calculate the total amount of money John made from selling the Lego sets:
\[ \text{Total money from Lego sets} = 13 \times 15 = 195 \]

Next, let's find out how much money John spent on the video games. Each video game costs $20 and he bought 8 video games:
\[ \text{Cost of video games} = 8 \times 20 = 160 \]

Now, we know that after buying the video games and having $5 left, the total amount of money John had is equal to the total amount he made minus the cost of the video games plus the remaining $5:
\[ \text{Initial amount of money} = 195 - 160 + 5 = 40 \]

"To determine how fast John runs, we need to calculate his total running time over the course of the week.

First, let's break down the running schedule:
- John runs 60 miles in a week.
- He runs 3 days a week.

On the first day, he runs for 3 hours.

For the next two days (the second and third days), he runs half as much time as on the first day. Therefore, each of these days he runs for:

\[
\frac{3 \text{ hours}}{2} = 1.5 \text{ hours}
\]

Now, let's calculate the total running time for the entire week:
- First day: 3 hours
- Second day: 1.5 hours
- Third day: 1.5 hours

Adding these together gives:

\[
3 + 1.5 + 1.5 = 6 \text{ hours}
\]

Next, we know that John runs 60 miles in 6 hours. To find his speed, we divide the total distance by the total time:

"To determine how far outside of the reach of the dragon's flames Polly can stand while holding the sapphire gemstone, we need to calculate the increased range of her throwing distance.

First, let's denote the original range of Polly's throwing javelin as \( R \). According to the problem, without the sapphire gemstone, Polly can throw the javelin for a distance of 400 feet. Therefore, \( R = 400 \) feet.

When Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, the range of her throwing javelin increases by a factor of 3. This means the new range becomes \( 3R \).

Substituting the value of \( R \):
\[ 3R = 3 \times 400 = 1200 \text{ feet} \]

This new range is greater than the dragon's maximum reach of 1000 feet. To find out how many feet beyond this point Polly can stand, we subtract the dragon's reach from the new range:
\[ 1200 - 1000 = 200 \text{ feet} \]

Therefore, if Polly holds the sapphire gemstone, she can stand 200 feet outside of"

"To determine how many toys Uriah needs to remove, we start by calculating the total weight of the comic books he plans to remove.

Each comic book weighs \(\frac{1}{4}\) pound, and he is removing 30 comic books. Therefore, the total weight of the comic books is:
\[
30 \times \frac{1}{4} = \frac{30}{4} = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Since Uriah needs to reduce the total weight of his book bag by 15 pounds, and he has already removed 7.5 pounds from the comic books, the remaining weight that needs to be reduced by toys is:
\[
15 - 7.5 = 7.5 \text{ pounds}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many toy books can be removed with a total weight of 7.5 pounds. Each toy book weighs \(\frac{1}{2}\) pound. Therefore, the number of toy books that can be removed is:

"To determine how many oranges are good in the basket, we start by identifying the total number of oranges and the distribution of each type.

The total number of oranges in the basket is 25.
- The number of bad oranges is given as 1.
- The number of unripe oranges is 20% of the total number of oranges. This means there are \(0.2 \times 25 = 5\) unripe oranges.
- The number of sour oranges is 2.

First, we calculate the number of good oranges:
\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = \text{Total number of oranges} - (\text{Number of bad oranges} + \text{Number of unripe oranges} + \text{Number of sour oranges})
\]
Substituting the known values:
\[
\text{Number of good oranges} = 25 - (1 + 5 + 2) = 25 - 8 = 17
\]

Thus, the number of good oranges is \(\boxed{17}\)."
"To determine how much Janet paid in total, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the initial cost of materials.
2. Add the cost of having the jewelry constructed.
3. Calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance.

Let's start with the first step:
The cost of materials is $500.

Next, we add the cost of having the jewelry constructed:
The construction cost is $800.

Now, we calculate the total cost before insurance:
Total cost before insurance = Cost of materials + Construction cost
Total cost before insurance = $500 + $800 = $1300

Finally, we calculate the insurance cost, which is 10% of the total cost before insurance:
Insurance cost = 10% of Total cost before insurance
Insurance cost = 0.10 * $1300 = $130

So, the total amount Janet paid is the sum of the costs of materials, construction, and insurance:
Total amount paid = Cost of materials + Construction cost + Insurance cost
Total amount paid = $500 + $800 + $130 = $1430

"To determine the difference in the amount of laundry done by Raymond and David, we start by defining the variables based on the information given.

1. Let \( D \) represent the amount of laundry David does.
2. According to the problem, Sarah does 4 times as much laundry as David. Therefore, Sarah's laundry is:
   \[
   S = 4D
   \]
3. The problem states that Sarah does 400 pounds of laundry. So, we can set up the equation:
   \[
   4D = 400
   \]

Next, we solve for \( D \):
\[
D = \frac{400}{4} = 100
\]
Thus, David does 100 pounds of laundry.

4. Since Raymond does half as much laundry as Sarah, we calculate Raymond's laundry:
   \[
   R = \frac{S}{2}
   \]
5. Substituting the value of \( S \) (which is 400 pounds):
   \[
   R = \frac{400}{2} = 200

"To determine how many times the alarm rang in total, we need to break down the ringing intervals and sum them up.

1. **First Ringing Interval:**
   - The first time the alarm went off, it rang 4 times.
   
2. **Second Ringing Interval:**
   - The second time the alarm went off, it rang for three times as long as the first time.
   - Since each ringing interval is independent of the others, this means it rang \(3 \times 4 = 12\) times.
   
3. **Third Ringing Interval:**
   - The third time the alarm went off, it rang for half as long as the second time.
   - Since each ringing interval is independent of the others, this means it rang \(\frac{1}{2} \times 12 = 6\) times.
   
Now, we add up the number of times the alarm rang:
\[
4 + 12 + 6 = 22

Christina invited 16 friends, but 1/4 of them don't show up. Therefore, 3/4 of the invited guests do show up. We can calculate the number of guests who actually attend as follows:
\[
\text{Number of guests who attend} = \frac{3}{4} \times 16 = 12
\]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of gift bags needed.**

Christina plans to give each guest one gift bag. Since there are 12 guests attending, she needs 12 gift bags.

**Step 3: Calculate the total cost of the gift bags.**

Each gift bag costs $2. Therefore, the total cost for 12 gift bags is:
\[
\text{Total cost} = 12 \times 2 = 24

"To determine how much potato salad Ted needs to bring to the picnic, we first calculate the amount of potato salad each group (adults and children) will consume.

First, let's find out how much potato salad one adult dinosaur will eat:
\[ \text{Potato salad per adult} = 10 \text{ lbs} \]

Next, we calculate the total amount of potato salad for the 20 adults:
\[ \text{Total potato salad for adults} = 20 \times 10 \text{ lbs} = 200 \text{ lbs} \]

Now, we need to find out how much potato salad one child will eat. Since a child eats half as much as an adult:
\[ \text{Potato salad per child} = \frac{10 \text{ lbs}}{2} = 5 \text{ lbs} \]

We then calculate the total amount of potato salad for the 5 children:
\[ \text{Total potato salad for children} = 5 \times 5 \text{ lbs} = 25 \text{ lbs} \]

Finally, we add the amounts together to get the total amount of potato salad needed:

"To determine the total number of pets that Jan, Marcia, and Cindy have together, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of pets Cindy has.
2. Use this information to find out how many pets Marcia has.
3. Use this information to find out how many pets Jan has.
4. Sum the number of pets each person has.

Let's start with the information given:
- Cindy has 4 pets.

Since Marcia has two more pets than Cindy, we can calculate the number of pets Marcia has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pets Marcia has} = 4 + 2 = 6 \]

Next, since Jan has three times the number of pets as Marcia, we can calculate the number of pets Jan has as follows:
\[ \text{Number of pets Jan has} = 3 \times 6 = 18 \]

Now, we sum the number of pets each person has to get the total number of pets:
\[ \text{Total number of pets} = \text{Pets Cindy has} + \text{Pets Marcia has} + \text{Pets Jan has} = 4 + 6 + 18 = 28 \]

"To determine how fast Gerald can now run the 400-meter hurdles after improving his speed by 10%, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine Lee's original running time for the 400-meter hurdles.
2. Calculate the improvement in Lee's running time due to the change in diet.
3. Find out how much faster Lee is now compared to before.
4. Use this information to find Gerald's new running time.

First, let's denote Lee's original running time as \( T_L \). According to the problem, Lee was able to run the 400-meter hurdles two seconds faster than Gerald could. Therefore, if Lee ran it in 38 seconds, then:
\[ T_G = T_L + 2 \]
Since \( T_L = 38 \) seconds, we have:
\[ T_G = 38 + 2 = 40 \text{ seconds} \]

Next, we know that Gerald's diet improved his speed by 10%. This means that his current running time \( T_{G}' \) is 90% of his original time \( T_G \). We can express this relationship mathematically as:
\[ T_{G}' = 0."
"To determine the total number of pets in the neighborhood, we start by defining the variables and using the given information step by step.

1. Let \( D \) represent the number of dogs.
2. Let \( C \) represent the number of cats.
3. Let \( R \) represent the number of rabbits.

From the problem, we know:
- The number of dogs (\( D \)) is 60.
- There are two cats for every dog. Therefore, the number of cats (\( C \)) can be calculated as:

"To find out the total number of doorbell rings that made, we need to calculate the number of times each friend pressed the doorbell and then sum those numbers.

First, let's determine how many times the second friend pressed the doorbell:
The second friend pressed the doorbell \( \frac{1}{4} \) times more than Jerome's first friend. Since the first friend pressed it 20 times, the second friend would have pressed it \( 20 + (20 \times \frac{1}{4}) = 20 + 5 = 25 \) times.

Next, let's find out how many times the third friend pressed the doorbell:
The third friend pressed the doorbell 10 times more than the fourth friend. Since the fourth friend pressed it 60 times, the third friend would have pressed it \( 60 + 10 = 70 \) times.

Now, we know that the fourth friend pressed the doorbell exactly 60 times.

So, the total number of doorbell rings is the sum of all these presses:
\( 20 \text{(first friend)} + 25 \text{(second friend)} + 70 \text{(third friend"

"Let's denote the number of cookies Henry intended to bake last year as \( x \). According to the problem, this year he will bake twice as many cookies, so he plans to bake \( 2x \) cookies.

However, when he bakes, he actually makes \( 2x + 15 \) cookies because he bakes 15 more than he intended. After baking, he drops 5 cookies, so the actual number of cookies left is:

\[ (2x + 15) - 5 = 2x + 10 \]

We know from the problem that after dropping the cookies, Henry ends up with 110 cookies. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:

\[ 2x + 10 = 110 \]

To find \( x \), we first subtract 10 from both sides of the equation:

\[ 2x = 100 \]

Next, we divide both sides by 2:

"To determine the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar Katy used, we start by understanding the given ratio and the total amount of ingredients used.

The ratio of teaspoons of sugar to cups of water is \(7:13\). This means for every 7 parts of sugar, there are 13 parts of water. The total parts of ingredients combined is:
\[7 + 13 = 20.\]

We know that the total amount of ingredients used is 120 teaspoons. Since these 120 teaspoons represent all 20 parts of the mixture, each part consists of:
\[\frac{120}{20} = 6 \text{ teaspoons}.\]

Since the amount of sugar is represented by 7 parts out of the total 20 parts, the number of teaspoonfuls of sugar used is:

"To determine how many letters were initially in the pile of already-stamped letters, we start by defining the initial number of letters in the stamping pile as \( x \). According to the problem, Jennie puts stamps on one-third of these letters, so she stamps \( \frac{x}{3} \) letters.

After stamping, the total number of letters in the stamping pile becomes:
\[ x - \frac{x}{3} = \frac{2x}{3}. \]

We know from the problem statement that after stamping, there are 30 letters in the pile of already-stamped letters. Therefore, we can set up the equation:
\[ \frac{2x}{3} = 30. \]

To find \( x \), we solve the equation by isolating \( x \):
\[ 2x = 30 \times 3, \]
\[ 2x = 90, \]
\[ x = \frac{90}{2}, \]
\[ x = 45. \]

Thus, the initial number of letters in the pile of already-stamped letters was \(\boxed{45}\)."

"To determine who will finish the race first and how long they will wait for each other, we need to calculate the time it takes for both Steve and Tim to travel from their respective homes to the school.

First, let's convert the distances from miles to feet:
- Steve lives 3 miles from the school.
- Tim lives 2 miles from the school.

Since there are 5280 feet in a mile, we have:
\[ \text{Distance for Steve} = 3 \times 5280 = 15840 \text{ feet} \]
\[ \text{Distance for Tim} = 2 \times 5280 = 10560 \text{ feet} \]

Next, we calculate the time it takes for each of them to reach the school using their respective speeds.

For Steve:
\[ \text{Time for Steve} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} = \frac{15840 \text{ feet}}{440 \text{ feet/minute}} = 36 \text{ minutes} \]

For Tim:
\[ \text{Time for Tim} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{"
"To determine how much Shawnda made from inflating the tires for the children in her neighborhood, we need to calculate the total number of tires inflated and then multiply by the cost per tire.

First, let's count the number of each type of tire:
- Bicycles have 2 tires each.
- Tricycles have 3 tires each.
- Unicycles have 1 tire each.

Next, we calculate the total number of tires for each group:

1. For the bicycles: 
   \[
   5 \text{ people} \times 2 \text{ tires/person} = 10 \text{ tires}
   \]

2. For the tricycles: 
   \[
   3 \text{ people} \times 3 \text{ tires/person} = 9 \text{ tires}
   \]

3. For the unicycle: 
   \[
   1 \text{ person} \times 1 \text{ tire/person} = 1 \text{ tire}
   \]

Now, we sum up all the tires:

10 \text{ tires (bicycles)} + 9 \text{ tires (tricycles)} + 1 \text{ tire"
"To determine how much change Carl receives, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys.
2. Determine the total cost of the cookies.
3. Subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid.

First, let's calculate the total number of cookies Carl buys. He buys 10 packs of cookies, and each pack contains 6 cookies:
\[
10 \text{ packs} \times 6 \text{ cookies per pack} = 60 \text{ cookies}
\]

Next, we calculate the total cost of the cookies. Each cookie costs $0.10, so for 60 cookies, the total cost is:
\[
60 \text{ cookies} \times \$0.10 \text{ per cookie} = \$6.00
\]

Now, we subtract the total cost from the amount Carl paid. Carl pays with a $10 bill:
\[
\$10.00 - \$6.00 = \$4.00
\]

Therefore, the change Carl receives is:
\[
\boxed{4}

"Let's denote the initial number of french fries in the pack as \( x \).

First, Dave ate 14 fries:
\[ x - 14 \]

Then, the seagull stole half of the remaining fries:
\[ \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) \]
So after the seagull, there are:
\[ (x - 14) - \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) = \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) \]

Three pigeons then bullied Dave away, with each pigeon eating 3 fries:
\[ 3 \times 3 = 9 \text{ fries eaten by the pigeons} \]
So after the pigeons, there are:
\[ \frac{1}{2}(x - 14) - 9 \]

A raccoon later stole two-thirds of the remaining fries:
\[ \frac{2}{3}\left(\frac{1}{2}(x - 14) - 9\right) \]
So after the raccoon, there are:
\[ \left(\frac{1}{2}(x - 14) - 9\right) - \frac{2}{"
"To determine the total number of hours Kimo spends attending class in one semester, we need to calculate his daily class time and then extend that to a full semester.

First, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends at classes on Monday, Wednesday, or Friday:
- Each day, he has 3 classes, and each class is 1 hour long.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day for these days is \(3 \text{ classes/day} \times 1 \text{ hour/class} = 3 \text{ hours/day}\).

Next, let's calculate the number of hours Kimo spends at classes on Tuesday or Thursday:
- Each day, he has 2 classes, and each class is 2 hours long.
- Therefore, the number of hours per day for these days is \(2 \text{ classes/day} \times 2 \text{ hours/class} = 4 \text{ hours/day}\).

Now, let's find out how many hours he spends at class during one week (Monday through Friday):

\[
\text{Total length of rolls} = 300 \times 4 = 1200 \text{ inches}
\]

Next, let's calculate the length of the chocolate croissants:
- Bill bakes 120 chocolate croissants.
- Each croissant is 6 inches long.
\[
\text{Total length of croissants} = 120 \times 6 = 720 \text{ inches}
\]

Then, let's calculate the length of the baguettes:
- Bill bakes 60 baguettes.
- Each baguette is 2 feet long. Since there are 12 inches in a foot, each baguette is \(2 \times 12 = 24\) inches long.
\[
\text{Total length of baguettes} = 60 \times 24 = "
"To determine how many bananas the zookeeper needs to order to feed the apes for 2 months, we first calculate the total number of bananas needed each month and then extend that to two months.

First, let's find out how many bananas are needed by each type of ape per month:
- The monkeys need 200 bananas per month.
- The gorillas need 400 bananas per month.
- The baboons need 100 bananas per month.

Next, we sum these amounts to get the total number of bananas needed per month:
\[ 200 \text{ (monkeys)} + 400 \text{ (gorillas)} + 100 \text{ (baboons)} = 700 \text{ bananas per month} \]

Since the zookeeper orders bananas every 2 months, we need to calculate the total number of bananas required over this period. We multiply the monthly requirement by 2:
\[ 700 \text{ bananas/month} \times 2 \text{ months} = 1400 \text{ bananas} \]

Therefore, the zookeeper needs to order \(\boxed{1400}\) bananas to last for 2 months"
"To determine how far each runner runs and by how much one outperforms the other, we need to calculate the distances for both Blake and Kelly.

First, let's calculate the distance Blake runs:
- Blake runs back and forth 15 times.
- The length of the football field is 100 yards.
- Therefore, the total distance Blake runs is \(15 \times 2 \times 100 = 3000\) yards.

Next, let's calculate the distance Kelly runs:
- Kelly runs back and forth 34 times initially.
- Each time she runs back and forth, she covers twice the length of the football field (since she goes from one end to the other).
- So, the initial distance Kelly runs is \(34 \times 2 \times 100 = 6800\) yards.
- After her initial run, Kelly continues running towards the 40-yard line and back.
- This means she runs an additional \(2 \times 40 = 80\) yards per round trip.
- Since she runs 34 times after reaching the 40-yard line, she completes 34 trips plus 1 more to reach the 40-yard line"
"To determine how much Raphael spent in total on his school supplies, we need to calculate the cost of each type of item he purchased and then sum these costs.

First, let's calculate the cost of the pens:

- Each notebook costs $4.

\[
\text{Cost of notebooks} = 2 \times 4 = 8
\]

Then, let's add the cost of the rim of bond paper:

\[
\text{Cost of rim of bond paper} = 20
\]

Now, we sum up all the individual costs to find the total amount Raphael spent:

\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of pens} + \text{Cost of notebooks} + \text{Cost of rim of bond paper}
\]

\[
\text{Total cost} = 6 + 8 + 20 = 34
\]

Therefore, Raphael spent a total of \boxed{34} dollars"
"To determine how many tadpoles Finn can still see in the pond, we need to follow these steps:

1. Start with the initial number of tadpoles Finn saw swimming.
2. Subtract the number of tadpoles that came out of hiding.
3. Subtract the number of tadpoles that hid again.

Let's go through each step:

1. Initially, there are 11 tadpoles swimming in the pond.
2. Then, 6 more tadpoles come out of hiding. So, we subtract 6 from 11:
   \[
   11 - 6 = 5
   \]
3. After some time, 2 more tadpoles hide under a rock. So, we subtract 2 from the remaining 5:
   \[
   5 - 2 = 3
   \]

Therefore, the number of tadpoles Finn can still see in the pond is \(\boxed{3}\)."

"To determine the total number of fish that Anakin and Locsin caught, we need to calculate the number of each type of fish each person caught and then sum these amounts.

First, let's find out how many fish Anakin caught:
- Starfish: \(10\)
- Sea horses: \(6\)
- Clownfish: \(3\)

So, the total number of fish Anakin caught is:
\[10 + 6 + 3 = 19\]

Next, let's determine how many fish Locsin caught:
- Starfish: \(10 - 5 = 5\) (since he caught 5 fewer starfish than Anakin)
- Sea horses: \(6 - 3 = 3\) (since he caught 3 fewer sea horses than Anakin)
- Clownfish: \(3 + 2 = 5\) (since he caught 2 more clownfish than Anakin)

So, the total number of fish Locsin caught is:
\[5 + 3 + 5 = 13\]

Now, we add the total number of fish caught by both Anakin and Locsin:
\[19 + 13 = 32\]

Therefore, the total number of fish they"
"To determine the cost of a bag of marbles after 36 months given that the price increases by 20% of the original price every two months, we can follow these steps:

1. Identify the initial price of the bag of marbles.
   The initial price is \( \$20 \).

2. Determine the number of two-month periods in 36 months.
   Since each period is two months, the number of periods in 36 months is:
   \[
   \frac{36}{2} = 18
   \]

3. Calculate the total increase in price over 36 months.
   Each two-month period results in an increase of 20% of the current price. Therefore, the total increase over 18 periods is equivalent to 18 increments of 20%. We need to find out what this total percentage increase means for the original price.

4. Use the formula for compound interest or exponential growth to calculate the final price. If the price increases by 20% every two months, then after one period (two months), the price becomes:
   \[
   20 \times 1.20 = 24
   \]
   After another period"
"To determine the total value of all the toys in the room, we need to find out the cost of each type of toy based on the given information.

First, let's define the variables:
- Let \( A \) be the cost of one action figure.
- Let \( R \) be the cost of one red car.
- Let \( D \) be the cost of one doll.

From the problem, we know:
1. One red car costs $4.
2. The doll costs as much as 3 action figures and one red car combined.

We can express these relationships mathematically:
\[ R = 4 \]
\[ D = 3A + R \]

Since we also know that one red car costs $4, we substitute \( R \) with 4:
\[ D = 3A + 4 \]

Now, we need to find the total value of all the toys. We will sum the values of the red cars, action figures, and dolls:
\[ \text{Total value} = 5R + 3A + D \]

Substitute \( R \) and \( D \) into the equation:
\[ \text{Total value} = 5(4) + 3A + ("
"To determine how much more money Jackie will have by hiring an accountant instead of doing her taxes herself, we need to calculate the total lost income from not being able to do her freelance work and then subtract that from the cost of hiring an accountant.

First, let's calculate the loss in income:
- Jackie would lose 3 hours of freelance work.
- She earns $35 per hour from freelance work.
- Therefore, the total loss in income is \(3 \text{ hours} \times \$35/\text{hour} = \$105\).

Next, we need to consider the cost of hiring an accountant, which is $90. Since the accountant charge covers the cost of not having to do the taxes themselves but does not cover the lost income directly, we only need to compare the direct costs:

The difference in income between doing the taxes herself and hiring an accountant is $105 (lost income) - $90 (cost of hiring the accountant) = $15.

So, Jackie will have \(\boxed{15}\) dollars less by hiring the accountant."

\]

Therefore, Sandra needs to babysit \(\boxed{5}\) times to collect enough eggs to make the 15 Spanish flans."
"Let's denote Brooke's current age by \( B \). Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age can be denoted by \( S = 2B \).

According to the problem, in 2 years, the sum of their ages will be 28. So we can write the equation:
\[ (S + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]

Substituting \( S = 2B \) into the equation, we get:
\[ (2B + 2) + (B + 2) = 28 \]
\[ 3B + 4 = 28 \]
\[ 3B = 24 \]
\[ B = 8 \]

So, Brooke is currently 8 years old. Since Seth is twice as old as Brooke, Seth's current age is:
\[ S = 2 \times 8 = 16 \]

Therefore, Seth is currently \(\boxed{16}\) years old."

First, let's identify the days of the week:
- Weekdays (Monday through Friday): 5 days
- Weekends (Saturday and Sunday): 2 days

Next, we know that Pancho walks 20 miles each weekday and 10 miles each weekend day.

Now, let's calculate the total miles walked during the weekdays:
\[
\text{Miles walked on weekdays} = \text{Number of weekdays} \times \text{Miles per weekday}
\]
\[
\text{Miles walked on weekdays} = 5 \times 20 = 100 \text{ miles}
\]

Then, let's calculate the total miles walked during the weekends:
\[
\text{Miles walked on weekends} = \text{Number of weekend days} \times \text{Miles per weekend day}
\]
\[
\text{Miles walked on weekends} = 2 \times 10 = 20 \text{ miles}
\]

Finally, we add the miles walked on weekdays and weekends to find the total miles walked in a week"

"Let's break down the information given:

1. Sally Forty-two (Sally Thirtytwo) is 8 years old.
2. Sally Two (Sally Four) is the same age as Sally Forty-two, so Sally Two is also 8 years old.
3. Granny Red is two times as old as Sally Four, which means Granny Red is \(2 \times 8 = 16\) years old.
4. Sally Two (Sally Four) is three years younger than Granny Red, so Granny Red is \(16 + 3 = 19\) years old.

Now we know:
- Sally Twenty-four (Sally Three) is one year younger than Sally Four, so Sally Twenty-four is \(8 - 1 = 7\) years old.
- Sally One (Sally Two) is already known to be 8 years old.

So, the ages of the four birds are:
- Sally Two: 8 years old
- Sally Four: 8 years old

"To determine how long it will take Billy to prep all 60 potatoes, we need to calculate the total time required for both peeling and cutting each potato.

First, let's find out how much time it takes to prepare one potato:
- Peeling time: 1.5 minutes = 90 seconds (since there are 60 seconds in a minute)
- Cutting time: 5 seconds

Total time per potato = Peeling time + Cutting time
Total time per potato = 90 seconds + 5 seconds = 95 seconds

Now, we multiply this by the number of potatoes:
Total time for 60 potatoes = Total time per potato × Number of potatoes
Total time for 60 potatoes = 95 seconds/peeled potato × 60 potatoes

Let's perform the multiplication:

\[
95 \text{ seconds/potato} \times 60 \text{ potatoes} = 5700 \text{ seconds}

"To determine the number of votes the loser received, we start by calculating the number of votes the winning candidate received.

The winning candidate received \(\frac{3}{4}\) of the total votes. Given that the total number of students who voted is 80, we can find the number of votes the winning candidate received by multiplying 80 by \(\frac{3}{4}\):

\[
\text{Votes for the winning candidate} = 80 \times \frac{3}{4}
\]

First, perform the multiplication:

\[
80 \times \frac{3}{4} = 80 \div 4 \times 3 = 20 \times 3 = 60
\]

So, the winning candidate received 60 votes.

Next, to find out how many votes the losing candidate received, we subtract the number of votes the winning candidate received from the total number of votes:

\[
\text{Votes for the losing candidate} = 80 - 60 = 20
\]

Therefore, the number of votes the losing candidate received is \(\boxed{20}\)."

W = \frac{200}{5} = 40
\]

Now that we know \( W = 40 \), we can find \( R \):
\[
R = 4W = 4 \times 40 = 160
\]

"To determine Jean's age, we need to first establish the ages of Mark and Jan based on the given information.

1. **Determine Mark's current age:**
   - We know that Jan is currently 30 years old.
   - Two years ago, Jan was \(30 - 2 = 28\) years old.
   - According to the problem, two years ago, Mark was 5 years older than half of Jan's age at that time. So, we can write:
     \[
     \text{Mark's age two years ago} = \frac{28}{2} + 5 = 14 + 5 = 19
     \]
   - Therefore, Mark is now \(19 + 2 = 21\) years old.

2. **Determine Jean's current age:**
   - The problem states that Jean is two years older than Mark. Since Mark is 21 years old, Jean's age is:
     \[
     21 + 2 = 23
     \]

Thus, Jean is \(\boxed{23}\) years old."
"To determine how many seconds the faster team wins by, we need to calculate the total time for both teams to complete the race.

First, let's calculate the total time for the slower team. The slower team consists of four runners who each run at a constant speed of 55 seconds per lap. Therefore, the total time for the slower team is:
\[
4 \times 55 = 220 \text{ seconds}
\]

Next, let's calculate the total time for the faster team. The faster team's runners have varying speeds. The first runner takes 60 seconds, the second runner takes 57 seconds, the third runner takes 54 seconds, and the fourth runner takes 51 seconds. Therefore, the total time for the faster team is:
\[
60 + 57 + 54 + 51 = 222 \text{ seconds}
\]

Now, we find the difference between the times of the faster team and the slower team:
\[
222 - 220 = 2 \text{ seconds}
\]

Thus, the faster team wins by \(\boxed{2}\) seconds."
"To determine how much more likely it is for Jerry to roll a number greater than 3 compared to rolling two even numbers in a row, we need to calculate the probabilities of each event and then find the difference between them.

First, let's calculate the probability of rolling a number greater than 3 on a six-sided die. The possible outcomes are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The numbers greater than 3 are 4, 5, and 6. There are 3 favorable outcomes out of 6 possible outcomes. Therefore, the probability \( P(\text{greater than 3}) \) is:
\[
P(\text{greater than 3}) = \frac{3}{6} = \frac{1}{2}
\]

Next, let's calculate the probability of rolling two even numbers in a row. The possible outcomes for a single roll are 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6. The even numbers are 2, 4, and 6. The probability of rolling an even number on one roll is:
\[

"To determine the total number of apples Jenna and her mother picked, we start by identifying the number of apples each person picked.

First, we know that Jenna's mother picked 20 apples. According to the problem, Jenna picked half as many apples as her mother. Therefore, we calculate the number of apples Jenna picked as follows:
\[
\text{Number of apples Jenna picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = \frac{1}{2} \times 20 = 10
\]

Next, we add the number of apples Jenna picked to the number of apples her mother picked to find the total number of apples they both picked:
\[
\text{Total number of apples} = \text{Number of apples Jenna picked} + \text{Number of apples her mother picked} = 10 + 20 = 30
\]

Thus, the total number of apples they both picked is \boxed{30}."
"To determine how many rats are in each cage, we need to analyze the distribution of straw step by step.

First, let's denote the number of rats as \( r \). Each rat receives 6 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total amount of straw distributed among the rats is:
\[ 6r \]

Next, we know there are 10 cages of hamsters with 10 hamsters in each cage. Each hamster receives 5 pieces of straw. Therefore, the total amount of straw distributed among the hamsters is:
\[ 10 \times 10 \times 5 = 500 \]
So, the total amount of straw distributed among all the small rodents (rats and hamsters) is:
\[ 6r + 500 \]

We are given that a total of 160 pieces of straw have been distributed. Therefore, we can set up the following equation:
\[ 6r + 500 = 160 \]

To find \( r \), we first isolate the term involving \( r \) by subtracting 500 from both sides of the equation:
\[ 6r = 160 - 500 \]

"To calculate the amount Mandy needs to pay Benedict after 3 months with a 2% monthly interest rate, we need to apply the formula for compound interest:

\[ A = P(1 + r)^n \]

Where:
- \( A \) is the amount of money accumulated after n periods, including interest.
- \( P \) is the principal amount (the initial sum of money).
- \( r \) is the annual interest rate (decimal). In this case, 2% per month means 24% annually because there are 12 months in a year.
- \( n \) is the number of times that interest is compounded per period.

Given:
\( P = \$100 \)
\( r = 2\% \text{ per month} = 0.02 \)
\( n = 3 \) months

Now, plug these values into the formula:

\[ A = 100(1 + 0.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.02)^3 \]
\[ A = 100(1.061208) \]
\[ A = \$106.1208 \]

"To determine how many bags of wheat the trader sold, we need to account for both the cost of purchasing the bags and the transportation cost, as well as the revenue generated by selling the bags.

Let's denote the number of bags the trader bought as \( x \).

1. **Cost of Purchasing Bags:**
   The trader pays $20 per bag for the wheat.
   \[
   \text{Total Cost} = 20x
   \]

2. **Transportation Cost:**
   Each bag costs $2 to transport.
   \[
   \text{Total Transportation Cost} = 2x
   \]

3. **Revenue from Selling Bags:**
   The trader sells each bag for $30.
   \[
   \text{Total Revenue} = 30x
   \]

The trader's profit is given by the difference between the total revenue and the sum of the total cost and the total transportation cost:
\[
\text{Profit} = \text{Total Revenue} - (\text{Total Cost} + \text{Total Transportation Cost})
\]
Substituting the expressions for total revenue, total cost, and total transportation cost, we get:
\[

"To determine how much each friend paid, we need to calculate the total cost and then divide it by three.

First, let's find out the cost of the fair tickets. The problem states that the three friends spent a total of $20.25 on tickets and that this amount is $4.50 less than what they spent on food. Therefore, the cost of the food can be calculated as follows:
\[
\text{Cost of food} = \text{Total ticket cost} + \$4.50 = \$20.25 + \$4.50 = \$24.75
\]

Next, we know that the cost of two rides is $33 per ride. So, the cost for two rides is:
\[
\text{Cost of two rides} = 2 \times \$33 = \$66
\]

Now, we can find the total cost by adding the cost of the tickets, the cost of the food, and the cost of the rides:
\[
\text{Total cost} = \text{Cost of tickets} + \text{Cost of food} + \text{Cost of two rides} = \$20.25 + \$24."
"To determine how many peaches John collects, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine the total amount of insects needed for the entire flock of ten ducks per day, we can follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the weekly insect consumption for one duck:**
   Each duck needs 3.5 pounds of insects per week.

2. **Calculate the weekly insect consumption for all ten ducks:**
   \[
   3.5 \text{ pounds/duck/week} \times 10 \text{ ducks} = 35 \text{ pounds/week}
   \]

3. **Convert the weekly insect consumption into daily insect consumption:**
   There are 7 days in a week, so:
   \[
   \frac{35 \text{ pounds/week}}{7 \text{ days/week}} = 5 \text{ pounds/day}
   \]

Thus, the ten ducks together need \(\boxed{5}\) pounds of insects per day."
"To determine how many trees Tom has after 10 years, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the net change in the number of trees each year.
2. Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.
3. Account for the trees that die after 10 years.

**Step 1: Calculate the net change in the number of trees each year.**

Each year, Tom plants 10 new trees and chops down 2 trees. Therefore, the net increase in the number of trees each year is:
\[ 10 - 2 = 8 \text{ trees per year} \]

**Step 2: Determine the total number of trees after 10 years.**

Starting with 50 trees, after 10 years, the total number of trees would be:

"To determine how many more pink plastic flamingos are out than white plastic flamingos at noon on Sunday, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

1. **Friday Morning:**
   The neighbors place 18 pink plastic flamingos out on Sue's front yard.
   \[
   \text{Pink flamingos on Friday} = 18
   \]

2. **Saturday Morning:**
   The neighbors take back one third of the flamingos from Friday.
   \[
   \text{Number of flamingos taken back} = \frac{18}{3} = 6
   \]
   Therefore, the number of pink flamingos left is:
   \[
   \text{Pink flamingos remaining after taking some back} = 18 - 6 = 12
   \]
   They then paint these 6 flamingos white and put them back on the lawn.

"To determine how much change Violetta will get, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total cost of the crayons.
2. Subtract the amount Violetta has from the total cost.

First, let's find out how many crayons Violetta can buy with her $20. Since each crayon costs $2, we divide $20 by $2:
\[
\frac{20}{2} = 10 \text{ crayons}
\]
So, Violetta can buy 10 crayons.

Next, we calculate the total cost of these 10 crayons. Each crayon costs $2, so we multiply the number of crayons by the cost per crayon:
\[
10 \times 2 = 20 \text{ dollars}
\]
This means the total cost of the crayons is $20. Since Violetta only has $20, she will not be able to buy all 10 crayons because she doesn't have enough money left after buying one crayon (which would cost her another $2).

However, if we assume Violetta buys as many crayons as possible within her budget, she can buy 9 crayons (since \(9 \"
"To determine the total cost of 8 pens, we need to first find out how much one pen costs.

We know that:
- A pen costs as much as a pencil and an eraser combined.
- A pencil costs $1.20.
- An eraser costs $0.30.

First, calculate the combined cost of a pencil and an eraser:
\[
1.20 + 0.30 = 1.50
\]

So, a pen costs $1.50.

Next, calculate the cost of 8 pens:
\[
8 \times 1.50 = 12.00

Therefore, the total cost for 8 pens is \(\boxed{12}\)."
"To determine how many pounds of carrots will not be used, we start by calculating the total amount of carrots that will be distributed among the 40 restaurants.

Each restaurant receives 2 pounds of carrots. Therefore, for 40 restaurants:
\[
40 \text{ restaurants} \times 2 \text{ pounds/restaurant} = 80 \text{ pounds}
\]

The initial amount of carrots available is 200 pounds. To find out how many pounds will remain after distributing them, we subtract the total distribution from the initial amount:
\[
200 \text{ pounds} - 80 \text{ pounds} = 120 \text{ pounds}
\]

Thus, the number of pounds of carrots that will not be used is:
\[
\boxed{120}

The total population of Soda is given as 23786 inhabitants. There are 8417 men and 9092 women in the city. First, we calculate the combined number of men and women:

\[ 8417 + 9092 = 17509 \]

Next, we subtract this sum from the total population to find the number of children:

\[ 23786 - 17509 = 6277 \]

Therefore, the number of children in Soda is \(\boxed{6277}\)."
"Let's calculate the number of Pokemon cards Elaine has after each month.

Initially, Elaine had 20 Pokemon cards.
After the first month, she collected three times that number:
\(3 \times 20 = 60\) cards.
So after the first month, she had \(20 + 60 = 80\) cards.

In the second month, she collected 20 fewer cards than those she collected in the first month:
\(60 - 20 = 40\) cards.
So after the second month, she had \(80 + 40 = 120\) cards.

In the third month, she collected twice the combined number of Pokemon cards she collected in the first and second months:
\(2 \times (60 + 40) = 2 \times 100 = 200\) cards.
So after the third month, she had \(120 + 200 = 320\) cards.

Therefore, Elaine now has a total of 320 Pokemon cards."
"To determine how much Mark makes in a week from editing sentences for both publishers, we need to follow these steps:

1. **Calculate the number of sentences edited by each publisher:**
   Since Mark edits a total of 1000 sentences each week and he edits an equal number of sentences for each publisher, the number of sentences edited by each publisher is:
   \[

"To determine how many barrels of wine Josie's farm produces per year, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount of grapes produced by the entire farm.
2. Determine how many barrels of wine can be made from the total amount of grapes.

First, we calculate the total amount of grapes produced by the entire farm. Since each acre produces 5 tons of grapes and there are 10 acres, we multiply the number of acres by the production rate per acre:
\[
10 \text{ acres} \times 5 \text{ tons/acre} = 50 \text{ tons}
\]

Next, we need to find out how many barrels of wine can be made from 50 tons of grapes. We know that each ton of grapes produces 2 barrels of wine. Therefore, we multiply the total tons of grapes by the number of barrels per ton:

"To determine how many kilometers Michael rode his bike over the two periods, we need to break down the problem into smaller steps.

First, let's calculate the distance Michael rode when he was riding his bike 5 times a week for 4 weeks:
- Each time he rides, he covers 25 kilometers.
- He rides 5 times per week.
So, the weekly distance is \(5 \times 25 = 125\) kilometers.
Over 4 weeks, the total distance is \(4 \times 125 = 500\) kilometers.

Next, let's calculate the distance Michael rode when he reduced his frequency of rides but increased the distance per ride:
- Now, he rides 2 times a week.

"To find the total cost of buying each cup, we need to follow these steps:

1. Determine the cost of one dozen cups.
2. Use this information to find the cost of twenty dozen cups.

First, let's denote the cost of one dozen cups as \( x \).

According to the problem, twenty dozen cups cost $1200 less than the total cost of half a dozen plates. The total cost of half a dozen plates is:
\[ 6000 \times \frac{1}{2} = 3000 \]

So, the cost of twenty dozen cups is:
\[ 2x - 1200 \]

This means that the cost of twenty dozen cups is equal to the cost of three dozen plates minus $1200. Since the cost of three dozen plates is:
\[ 6000 \times 3 = 18000 \]

We can set up the equation:
\[ 2x - 1200 = 18000 \]

Now, solve for \( x \):

First, let's calculate the perimeter of the rectangle. The formula for the perimeter \(P\) of a rectangle is:
\[ P = 2 \times (\text{length} + \text{width}) \]

The length of the park is 6 miles and the width is 1.5 miles. So, substituting these values into the formula gives:
\[ P = 2 \times (6 + 1.5) = 2 \times 7.5 = 15 \text{ miles} \]

Next, we know that Gary walks at a speed of 3 miles per hour. To find out how long it takes him to walk 15 miles, we use the formula:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{\text{Distance}}{\text{Speed}} \]
Substituting the distance and speed into this formula gives:
\[ \text{Time} = \frac{15}{3} = 5 \text{ hours} \]

Therefore, the number"
"To determine the number of customers Sloane counted on the third day, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of customers counted on the first day.
2. Use this information to find out how many customers were counted on the second day.
3. Add the number of customers from the first and second days to find the total for the third day.

First, we know that on the first day, Sloane counted 100 customers. On the second day, she counted 50 more customers than the first day. Therefore, the number of customers counted on the second day is:
\[ 100 + 50 = 150 \]

Next, we are given that the total number of customers by the end of the third day was 500. This means that the sum of the customers counted on the first, second, and third days equals 500. We can express this relationship with the following equation:
\[ 100 + x + y = 500 \]
where \( x \) is the number of customers counted on the first day (which is 100), and \( y \) is the number of customers counted on the second day (which is 1"
"Let's denote the current amount of water in the small pool by \( S \) and the current amount of water in the big pool by \( B \).

First, we know that each pool is leaking at a rate of 4 gallons per minute. Therefore, the amount of water lost from each pool over the past 4 minutes is:
\[ 4 \text{ gallons/minute} \times 4 \text{ minutes} = 16 \text{ gallons}. \]

So, before the leak started, the big pool contained \( B + 16 \) gallons and the small pool contained \( S + 16 \) gallons.

According to the problem, 4 minutes ago, the big pool had twice as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:
\[ B - 16 = 2(S - 16). \]
Simplifying this equation, we get:
\[ B - 16 = 2S - 32, \]
\[ B = 2S - 16. \tag{1} \]

Also, it is given that now the big pool has four times as much water as the small pool. This gives us the equation:

"To determine how many hours Lori needs to work to afford the shoes and the belt, we first need to calculate the total cost of both items.

The cost of the shoes is $320.00.
The cost of the belt is $32.00.

Adding these together gives:
\[ 320 + 32 = 352 \]

So, the total amount Lori needs to spend is $352.00.

Next, we need to find out how many hours Lori needs to work to earn $352.00 if she earns $8.00 per hour. We do this by dividing the total cost by her hourly wage:

\[ 352 \div 8 = 44 \]

Therefore, Lori needs to work for \(\boxed{44}\) hours before she can afford the shoes and the belt."
"To determine Janeth's remaining balance after her loan repayment, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay.
2. Determine how many payments Janeth will make.
3. Calculate the monthly payment amount.
4. Subtract the total amount paid from the total amount needed to repay.

First, let's calculate the total amount Janeth needs to repay. She agreed to return the original amount plus an additional 10%, which means she will pay back \(2000 + (2000 \times 0.10) = 2000 + 200 = 2200\).

Next, we know that Janeth will make 12 equal monthly payments of $165 each. The total amount paid over the 12 months is \(165 \times 12 = 1980\).

Now, we subtract the total amount paid from the total amount needed to repay:
\[2200 - 1980 = 220.\]

Therefore, Janeth's remaining balance by then is \(\boxed{220}\)."
"To determine the total number of flowers in the vase, we need to follow these steps:

1. Identify the number of roses in the vase.
2. Calculate the number of dahlias in the vase.
3. Add the number of roses and dahlias together to find the total number of flowers.

Step 1: The number of roses is given as 4.

Step 2: The number of dahlias is 7 more than the number of roses. Therefore, we calculate the number of dahlias as follows:
\[ \text{Number of dahlias} = \text{Number of roses} + 7 = 4 + 7 = 11 \]

Step 3: To find the total number of flowers, we add the number of roses and the number of dahlias:
\[ \text{Total number of flowers} = \text{Number of roses} + \text{Number of dahlias} = 4 + 11 = 15 \]

Thus, the total number of flowers in the vase is \(\boxed{15}\)."
"To find the average age of Adrian, Harriet, and Zack in three years, we need to follow these steps:

"To determine how many minutes Jason has left for the rest of his calls this month, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of minutes Jason spends on calls with his boss.
2. Add the extra minutes he used for other calls.
3. Subtract the total minutes spent from the monthly limit.

First, calculate the total minutes spent on calls with his boss:
\[ \text{Minutes with boss} = 15 \text{ minutes/day} \times 30 \text{ days} = 450 \text{ minutes} \]

Next, add the extra minutes used for other calls:
\[ \text{Total minutes used} = 450 \text{ minutes} + 300 \text{ minutes} = 750 \text{ minutes} \]

Now, subtract the total minutes used from the monthly limit:
\[ \text{Minutes remaining} = 1000 \text{ minutes} - 750 \text{ minutes} = 250 \text{ minutes} \]

Therefore, the number of minutes Jason has left is:
\[ \boxed{250} \]"
"To determine how many fries Ginger gave Griffin, we need to follow the sequence of events step by step.

1. **Initial number of fries:**
   Griffin starts with 24 fries.
   
2. **Fries taken by Kyle:**
   Kyle takes 5 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   24 - 5 = 19
   \]
   Now Griffin has 19 fries.
   
3. **Fries taken by Billy:**
   Billy takes twice as many fries as Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[
   2 \times 5 = 10
   \]
   Billy takes 10 fries from Griffin.
   \[
   19 - 10 = 9
   \]
   Now Griffin has 9 fries.
   
4. **Fries given by Ginger:**
   Let \( G \) be the number of fries Ginger gives Griffin initially.
   After receiving these fries, Griffin has:
   \[
   9 + G
   \]
   
5. **Fries taken by Colby:**
   Colby takes 3 fewer fries than Kyle. Since Kyle took 5 fries:
   \[

"To determine the number of fish in each aquarium, we start by defining the variables and setting up the equations based on the given information.

Let \( F \) be the number of fish in each aquarium. Since there are 4 snails in the first aquarium and 32 snails in the second aquarium, the total number of snails in both aquariums combined is:
\[ 4 + 32 = 36. \]

According to the problem, the difference between the number of snails in the two aquariums is twice the number of fish in both aquariums. This can be expressed as:
\[ |4 - 32| = 2F. \]
Simplifying the left side, we get:
\[ 28 = 2F. \]
Solving for \( F \), we divide both sides by 2:
\[ F = 14. \]

Thus, the number of fish in each aquarium is \(\boxed{14}\)."
"To determine how much Jean paid, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total number of hours spent on makeup.
2. Determine the base cost before any discounts.
3. Apply the 10% discount.

**Step 1: Calculate the total number of hours spent on makeup.**

Jean's makeup artist charges $250 per hour. She works 6 hours a day and needs the makeup done 4 times a week. Since the movie takes 5 weeks to finish, we first find out how many days are required for all the makeup sessions combined.

Total days = Number of days per session * Number of sessions per week * Number of weeks
Total days = 6 days/session * 4 sessions/week * 5 weeks = 120 days

Now, calculate the total number of hours spent:
Total hours = Total days * Hours per day
Total hours = 120 days * 6 hours/day = 720 hours

**Step 2: Determine the base cost before any discounts.**

Base cost = Total hours * Hourly rate
Base cost = 720 hours * $250/hour = $180,000

**Step 3: Apply"
"To determine how much Isabelle paid per person, we first need to calculate the total amount she spent on all the party supplies. We do this by adding up the costs of the individual items:

\[
12 + 43 + 15 + 4 + 22 = 96
\]

So, Isabelle spent a total of $96. Since she split this cost evenly among herself and her two parents (which makes three people in total), we divide the total cost by 3:

\[
\frac{96}{3} = 32
\]

Therefore, each person paid \(\boxed{32}\) dollars."
"To determine how much the chef spent on the onions, we need to follow these steps:

1. Calculate the total weight of the onions.
2. Determine the total cost based on the price per pound.

First, let's find the total weight of the onions. The chef bought 4 bags, and each bag weighs 50 pounds. So, the total weight is:
\[ 4 \text{ bags} \times 50 \text{ pounds/bag} = 200 \text{ pounds} \]

Next, we know that the cost of onions is $1.50 per pound. Therefore, the total cost for 200 pounds of onions is:
\[ 200 \text{ pounds} \times \$1.50/\text{pound} = \$300 \]

So, the chef spent \(\boxed{300}\) dollars."
"To determine how many more calories Sue consumed than her sister, we need to follow these steps:

2. Determine the number of cookies Sue ate each day.
3. Calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed.
4. Calculate the total number of calories Sue's sister consumed.
5. Find the difference in the number of calories consumed by Sue and her sister.

**Step 1: Calculate the number of cookies Sue's sister ate each day.**

- On Monday, Sue's sister ate 5 cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue's sister ate \(13 \times 5 = 65\) cookies.

**Step 2: Determine the number of cookies Sue ate each day.**

- On Monday, Sue ate \(4 \times 5 = 20\) cookies.
- On Tuesday, Sue ate \(2 \times 65 = 130\) cookies.

**Step 3: Calculate the total number of calories Sue consumed.**
